11,"['add', 'stuff', 'behind', 'players', 'chats', 'like', 'anson', 'hi', 'system', 'check', 'website', 'robux', 'roblox', 'robux']",45,they add stuff behind other players chats like anson hi {system}check out the website robux roblox for robux

13,"['roblox', 'scams', 'never', 'fully', 'blocked', 'like', 'glitches', 'games', 'something', 'obnoxious', 'still', 'blocked', 'nullified', 'still']",50,roblox scams will never be fully blocked like glitches in games it's something that is obnoxious but still can't all be blocked nullified but still there

20,"['teach', 'kid', 'know', 'scammed']",93,teach your kid what you know and then they won’t get “scammed”

comments and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a roblox shill or a year old kid that really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you as you're opinion's already been made i'm not sure if you know this but roblox does not make the games all of roblox's content is completely player made well with the exception of some events and tutorial games heck the whole point of roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games what does this mean any multiplayer game has the danger of adults and susceptible children meeting it's not a new thing usually the multiplayer game has safeguards such as safe chat child friendly mode or whatever but in the end it's ultimately up to you to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online the game can only do so much it's almost the same in roblox's case these are multiplayer interactions between players to players people playing other player's games not player to company you see that's the huge difference they can't be held accountable in the same ways i hope you understand that i'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason not because i only read a few sentences of your comments the solution is with you guys not the other way around look i understand that these practices are quite shitty but there's a real difference between actual scams and these scams i've seen games get taken down for real scams for instance you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t shirt that's a real bonifide scam meanwhile with your case you're getting what you pay for sure the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated but the gamepass never promised how long the game would last did it scummy but legal these practices are not criminal despite how close they may seem taking action against things like these leave a huge precedent and could be damaging for all of roblox let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of where does the solution lie that's right with you your son is choosing to play these games and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform he is choosing to play these scammy games despite there being tons of other games out there issues that are out of his control like nudity swearing etc that is the type of stuff roblox is trying to prevent children should never ever be taken advantage of by adults i agree but its the goddamn internet it never ever will be safe like c'mon if your child can't handle roblox maybe it's not the company's fault it's not roblox's job on how to teach your kid st century skills they do what they can but when it comes to issues born out of free will what the hell are they supposed to do your kid wants to buy this stuff and if it's due to manipulation and targeting then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit as long as free speech exists manipulation will too connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities you know that if you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff then of course

a moderation story i am pretty sure appeals is never going to get back to us with anything useful so i mainly want to share this so others don't end up in a similar situation at first i was just planning on posting up the very frustrating appeals emails with roblox support but i am not sure it would be helpful it seems it is well known that the appeals system is broken and not in place to assist users instead i am just going to post up about what led to my kids account being banned hopefully this can serve to prevent other young peeps from having a similar situation happen to them my year old has been playing roblox for a number of years and absolutely loves it we enjoy the freedom she has by being able to play a huge number of game types in one place and she even recently started to try her shot at making her own games she watched a youtuber create a clone of adopt me and wanted to try it herself danger zone at the time i was unaware that this was against the tos as there are innumerable such games all over roblox i imagined it would be a good way to get a feel for game creation and provide further ideas for how she might want to create her own games she found some resources in roblox studio from adopt me danger zone and whipped out a quick game at the time i thought nothing of it after all if what she was doing was a problem why would there be so many games that looked just like the popular ones a couple days after publishing her game she goes to her computer and it says her account has been banned specifically for creating a phishing game designed to scam other players i can assure you she has no idea what phishing is now she does because i had to define it for her so i guess the learning is a silver lining she only knows what scamming is in terms of what she should look for when someone is trying to get her to do something wrong she was devastated not only was her account banned but for a reason she didn't even understand she does extra chores for robux and invests real time and effort into the platform now she is not sure if she ever wants to put in the same effort again and i don't blame her after being hit with a capricious ban she doesn't even want to open roblox studio for the fear that what she might do could get her new account banned every time she goes to play an old favorite she has that halting realization that all the time she put into it was wasted and the robux she used to get vip is completely gone she tries to pretend like it's not a big deal but each time she tries something she used to do she gets real quiet and sad i tried to get more information from the appeals system as to exactly what she did that was considered phishing or scamming at best by looking here and in the devforums i believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it without official confirmation this is complete conjecture appeals was unwilling to give me any actual useful information and has ghosted us on responses after the first few that were obvious form letters i mainly don't understand how it moved to immediate ban and kangaroo court appeals there is no room to grow or understand i am greatly disappointed in roblox a platform i had previously recommended heavily to friends and their kids but it has let us down immensely this disappointment is compounded even further by not having any useful official channel to resolve grievances literally the only thing i can do is post here on reddit which is at best just so i can say to my daughter that i tried everything i could think of maybe i'll wait for the ipo buy a share and go complain at an investors meeting i sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else as it was a fairly traumatic to a year old tl;dr be very careful about letting your kids use roblox studio as it may lead to bans for offenses they do not understand and you will not receive justification for also be careful what you let you kids copy from youtube giant important follow up after all the super useful information here i put in one last hail mary email to appeals about the free models containing malicious code and how it was unfair to expect a child to understand those dangers just got a response from appeals and they changed her ban to a warning which i honestly did not expect at all for anyone else in a similar situation i highly recommend persevering while also being unfailingly polite while the end result is a win i still feel roblox needs to improve their customer service i am just glad that at least some of my faith in roblox as an entity has been restored

app itself > it would certainly be nice of roblox to implement something like that but i think making it a regulation is inappropriate given the other ways to restrict purchases what dollar amount would you suggest is too much what would you do when the kid just opens up mom's email account on the ipad and confirms the purchases there are no layers of protection you can put in place that kids won't bypass if you give them access to your accounts if you don't think putting a pin on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable why would you think putting a pin on the email account is reasonable given we see this kind of story frequently in the news this is not a one off problem it should be a regulation at this point because we clearly can't trust companies to voluntarily behave as for a dollar amount i'd set it around the price of a full fat game so £ i'd say the kid having to open a separate program entirely adds enough extra difficulty and friction to put the blame on the kid theres a difference between deliberate action and just clicking accept blindly on the popups in your game there are never foolproof answers but we don't say there is no point regulating anything we accept that regulation is *risk reduction* and that's worth having > if you don't think putting a pin on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable why would you think putting a pin on the email account is reasonable because i'd expect my email to have non kid friendly info in it but wouldn't necessarily expect a kids game to be able to charge thousands of pounds want an example from an earlier age of tech it used to be common for kids tv shows to have call in contests on premium rate numbers this obviously caused unexpected bills as parents weren't used to guarding the phone it had never been an issue before because the premium rate services were all targetted at adults the solution that got in place was incredibly weak shows were forced to say remember to get the bill payers permission before making a call but worked pretty well were there still instances of kids calling in without permission absolutely but much less than before without much in the way of friction or fanfare

card without confirmation then there would be no excuse that you gave it to your kid without knowing it requiring certain kinds of purchases to get confirmation even when the company doesn't know it's a kid is problematic and requiring the confirmation when the company knows it's a kid is already built in share the password to your finances with irresponsible people win stupid prizes if there was a

you can either block those games which you feel are inappropriate for a child’s given age or if you go with the limited “curated content only” your child is prohibited from chatting with any friends in any game whatsoever this seems entirely unreasonable the over under setting does little to nothing the “allow only curated content” still shows all of the user generated content simply with an x over the play sign so the child can still see everything they can’t play gets frustrated about it as they seek curated content and can’t talk with friends the “all or nothing” approach to safety and security for children feels more like mere lip service to parents who are trying to monitor their children’s internet time a or year old wants to play roblox so they can chat with their friends prohibiting this defeats the purpose of the entire platform and really prohibits the child from effectively playing many of the games which require some level of communication furthermore displaying all that the child is not allowed to play merely insights frustration as opposed to many other internet mechanisms by which a parent can block an app a website or a game that is inappropriate after which it no longer shows up furthermore many of the games in the user generated content are age appropriate for younger kids and are the more popular games so the curated option includes removing the ability for a child to play games which are both popular and age appropriate ie islands at the same time roblox does nothing to monitor inappropriate games with xenophobic or sexual themes and deprives the parent of the ability to block these games from a child the entire parental safety mechanism is wholly inadequate every other type of platform allows for customization of age rated games customization of chat mechanisms and the ability of the parent to help their child play safely this includes the internet itself where websites can be blocked or allowed lastly the ability to monitor roblox chats only along with inability to monitor in game chats without the parent watching live the entire time is a serious failure of the platform this system sets parents up for failure and promotes frustration and resentment with the children roblox claims to be concerned about the safety and well being of their players yet they take no responsibility for monitoring user generated content provide no realistic mechanism which allows a parent to work with the child to determine what is appropriate which varies greatly even between ages and and places all responsibility of reporting inappropriate content or behavior on the users which for the record they do little or nothing about i have personally reported games which i have witnessed sexual content and the encouragement of inappropriate and sexual behavior i have provided screenshots as proof i have received nothing more than a canned response saying i should enable “curated content” only and refusing to address the inability to chat once this is implemented i have reported games which promote violence in conjunction with xenophobic themes i provided screenshots in support thereof again i received a canned response about parental controls never mind the fact that child can create a new account with nothing more than a name and a birthdate which does nothing to block content aside from a few ### in chats at what point does roblox take any responsibility for their content and or lack of useful safety settings which would at least allow a parent to have reasonable controls over what their child can play and do on the platform if a roblox is going to market to kids from years of age see their toys to young adults there needs to be more than the current useless black and white all or nothing parental controls the technology exists they simply refuse to implement it and or make it available i can only assume their “concern for the children”propaganda is nothing more than a public affairs cya as they hoist all of the responsibility of monitoring behavior and content of their platform onto their young players which maybe just maybe would fly if they ever actually did anything about it but their statements re their concern are disingenuous at best given the lack of response when said reports are actually made this is not unreasonable and this is not the ranting of a parent who doesn’t want to monitor their child’s activity these are the words of a concerned parent watching a company market to millions of young children who are desperate for socialization especially during a pandemic and making millions on them and their parents while depriving users and their parents of the most simplistic of tools needed to ensure the safety and well being of our kids and on a final note the recommendations by some that parents can just block the game as a whole or just set the all or nothing restrictions and get over it is not a response or solution it’s ignoring the problem and passing the buck

survivor tv show clones to fashion shows to zombie games its free to play but there is paid content as well the site is specifically targeted to kids and teens there's a chat feature that can be disabled and it is somewhat heavily auto moderated i want to take a moment and share my experiences with it along with a question or two and to invite you to do the same my year old and year old have been playing games on the platform for a while and both seem to love it recently the year old has gotten interested in the social aspect friends and chat as i said the chat feature can be disabled and i explained to her that if we run into problems with chat that we'd turn it off we've worked hard to set expectations so that everyone is clear on the front end the friend aspect is rather like the steam game platform and you can request that people become your friend it doesn't seem to have much impact other than that you can see if they are in a game and join a game that they are in as well as messaging the computer monitor faces our family living room so its easy to see at a glance what's going on i don't tend to hover constantly but when she's reading or typing in the chat window i make a point to give it a fairly frequent look it is as much an exercise in guarding against nefariousness as it is in trying to help and guide her in understanding online interactions we have of course talked about safety and predators online but tbh i'm more worried about hard or soft bullying online which we also talk about one of the things that i'm really working with her on is this friends thing there's one person that she's befriended that has a cute sounding name along the lines of unicornsparkle the year old is delighted when this other person is in the same game with her and talks to me about this person i get the feeling that she's drawn to this person largely by their name and avatar outfit and less by any quantitative qualities i don't mind that but i'm working to help her get an understanding of what it means to be friends with someone in an online setting she has expressed an interest in learning to touch type so we've found a couple of resources for that i think this may help her now and later as her typing is pretty slow and basic and i've noticed a couple of times that her chat responses come so delayed as to lose all context and once or twice have been misunderstood or misconstrued here's some of the rules and expectations that we have setup for her * do not give out your name we let her come up with a 'nickname' so that she can offer her name if asked without giving out her personal information * don't give out other personal info location etc someone asked her age the other day and she was quick to not give her actual age but after thinking about it a moment age doesn't seem like 'bad' information * no secrets * she won't be in trouble for anything that anyone posts or that she sees if she has questions about anything that she saw or read she can ask and we'll talk about them no judging * we expect her to be kind just as she would to someone in rl no namecalling making fun bullying etc * if someone says things that are unkind to her or other people she should avoid them and can let us know standing up against bullying is also encouraged * she uses the computer with our permission and asks if she's not sure of something we have the philosophy that there are dangers on the internet but we don't want to fall into the trap of believing that a child abductor is hiding behind every bush she's up to speed on safety in that regard and it is relatively easy to protect her from this threat she is far more likely to run into an unkind person or bully and it is more difficult to protect her from that i feel that by teaching her about these things early that i can help arm her with the information that she needs to be safe and healthy and have respect for herself and others in an online setting other parents what have been your experiences with roblox positive negative or otherwise if your children are into roblox at what age did they become interested in the social aspect of it and what did do you allow thanks

try to integrate some stuff to make it seem like they aren’t missing out regular youtube can be pretty bad that’s why i like youtube kids you can pick individual creators and other content so that you know what they’re watching you can start by picking stuff and previewing it although i’m not sure at what age this becomes pointless tiktok is a hard no many predators on there and messed up stuff a kid that age doesn’t need to be exposed to there’s actually no value to it unlike youtube where there’s lots of easy to monitor content that can be educational or fun youtube is already not great for adhd kids if they tend to flip through stuff so tiktok would be a pretty tough one on the attention span with the short videos and whatnot roblox is tough there’s a lot of content on there that’s fine but the kids and adults may not be it helps that they’ve really limited what can be said on chat but if you’re still worried you can filter this by turning off chat options but i’m not sure how easy it would be for a kid her age to undo that and haven’t had to do that myself yet i recommend monitoring her chats with friends i personally know parents who’s children have sent images to friends that they shouldn’t have and those things have been shared and lots of bullying that can happen don’t do this behind her back i would say that you just need to have a conversation with her about how things can be safe and you want to make sure she is safe not that you are constantly looking at stuff but that you will check in occasionally to make sure everything is pg or if you feel like you don’t want to intrude at all there may be a way to prevent picture sharing etc on the kids messenger app i think in a couple years these restrictions can be lifted as you see fit but regardless you need to have a conversation with her about the internet if you haven’t already this can be as simple as hey just like the real world the internet isn’t safe always there is adult stuff that you don’t want to see and that there are people that may try to talk to you for the wrong reasons this is why you only talk to people that you know in real life that are your friends in chat if you’re on roblox and you’re playing with someone you don’t know do not give out personal information because we don’t know who they are and there’s no way of knowing you don’t want a stranger to know where we live or your full name because we don’t know if they are safe even if you think they may be nice in a couple years you can add more details as questions may arise another thing is you let your kid know that if there’s anything that they see or find on the internet that makes them feel weird or scares them they can always come to you and talk about it you won’t be mad there’s a lot of things children just won’t understand and may not be ready to be exposed to you’re there for them and can help explain anything that may be weird you’re right sometimes it can be a disservice when they get old enough to make those decisions or go behind your back and haven’t had any of this conversation or exposure to the internet it can put them in very dangerous situations you’re doing great hope this helps

enough i've never posted here but i'm looking for some advice ideas my year old daughter loves roblox and she used to get screentime to call her friends and play together on her ipad over a week ago i noticed i got locked out of my amazon account and when i checked my email to get back into my account there were hundreds of dollars of suspicious charges the customer service rep confirmed it was roblox and it took over an hour over the phone but luckily they refunded it all they said it can be tricky to get refunded my daughter had her ipad taken away and wasn't allowed to talk to friends for a week i was under the impression that her ipad wasn't in kid mode and that must've allowed the purchases because in four years she had never bought anything before today after a talk and promises to never ever do that again i gave her the ipad back with kid mode on sure enough though i was going through my email and i found a ton of purchases again only a couple of hours after she got it back i was furious we had another long conversation about how wrong it is to steal from mom and how disappointed and disgusted i am and i said that her ipad is gone indefinitely i'll have to call amazon in the morning again to hopefully get that money back too because i'm broke long story short i quit my job to care for my terminally ill mother and i haven't found anything remote yet so i only have a couple hundred dollars in my checking as it is i'm fucked if amazon doesn't refund me she was told there would again be no friends no tv or anything fun tomorrow especially just working with me outside or doing cleaning around the house i feel like i don't know how to make it sink in or what to say to make her understand i never would've dreamed of doing this to my parents and she looked ashamed but i feel like i don't know if she gets it hell i question if she's just so short sighted that she didn't think there'd be any consequences or if she just doesn't respect me because she ignored everything we had just talked about is there something i'm missing to make her understand i tried to explain that when she buys things online with my card it's the same thing as reaching in my wallet and pulling out money i'm just not sure if it's not a serious enough consequence or if i need to focus more on how i discuss it with her to make her realize her wrongs i worry that she's not afraid of consequences or doesn't care enough about them which tells me that maybe i'm missing the mark and not getting through to her is there something else i should add for a punishment is there more i should add to the discussion i was flustered so i didn't ask about why she did it just focused on how it felt to have her do that to me for a second time honestly i don't know if the 'why' matters i'm just hurt afraid i can't get that money back and feeling like i don't have my kid's respect tl;dr my daughter made in game purchases on my card was punished and immediately did it a second time when she got it back not sure if my punishments or discussions are enough to make her change her behavior and understand how terrible stealing is how can i help her understand how serious this is and be sure she respects me edit thank you everyone for the responses and suggestions roblox is gone for sure i will continue my discussion with money and i will have her earn the money back i will say that after the first time i changed up the passwords made sure that she couldn't get into my account without a second different password and i had assumed that without my adult account she couldn't make any purchases because the older ipad she had would always block purchases unless i logged in i've gone through the game with her before and there are a lot of ads and in game purchases but she pointed them out to me and said you have to buy those so don't click on them so naively i thought she knew to never buy anything as this was long before the problem began i will talk to her more about the 'why' again because i know she likes to video chat her friends and she might have felt pressured to buy that

really have anyone to ask background due to some unfortunate circumstances my year old niece is now under my care full time i am very new to all of this a couple months ago i noticed some strangers pop up on her facebook messenger app and asked her about it she admitted to not knowing these people irl and that she just randomly added them on facebook we had great discussions about internet safety removed everyone she didn't personally know and i had high hopes we were all good we weren't the next incident occurred about a month later on a snapchat account i didn't even know she had she would apparently download the app to use and then delete it so i wouldn't see it well one morning i guess she forgot to delete the app and i noticed a snapchat notification on her phone so i opened it up she once again randomly added a ton of people like who she would talk and send pictures to at all hours of the night normally snapchat doesn't save your messages unless you specifically set it to which she and the creeps she was speaking with had the chats and photos i had the absolute horror of discovering were unbelievably explicit the absolute worse you can imagine believe me there was so much it was all she used the app for obviously i freaked out i grounded her from her devices explained how dangerous and inappropriate what she is doing was had a bit a melt down myself afterwards and life went on a few weeks later i see a notification on my own facebook that my niece had joined a group odd as she has no device so i checked into it using her school computer she has an iep allowing her a personal laptop at school to do her work she had joined a facebook group for adults to specifically speak explicitly with one another so another talk more privileges taken for a period of time eventually she gets her phone back with limited access and periodic check ins to see what she's up to she's behaving schools going good no issues on the phone so i get a bit lax allowed her messenger again for people she knows with checkups and roblox this leads up to last nights incident since getting roblox back she has been sneaking her phone at night and set up a pinterest account in the browser as she can't download apps and has been continuing to contact people by telling them to add her on there and using the chat feature pinterest i didn't even know there was a chat function one final detail that i am reluctant to even put into words all of it from the very beginning was very intense sexting surrounding a dd lg relationship like very specifically always this the facebook group she joined was for one to find the other i don't know if this means anything am i reading into this too much it's like she will do anything to talk to these creeps in this way like go to any length to be able to do this i can't give her a phone to contact me or anyone else or vice versa because it's like she will always find a way there's no way this is acceptable right this is not normal preteen teenage behavior right

late and i told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows i said no she would say yes sometimes when kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with kylee trying to defend her i bought kylee an iphone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps i told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and i don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks grandma and grandma said yes i explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen kylee asked grandma if she could get a monthly subscription to an app using her card i said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes this leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card i tell her not to let kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen grandma let's kylee add her card to her phone again although i told them both she is not allowed to do this this time it leads to kylee signing back up for the subscription with grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy roblox also with grandma's permission grandma forgets she allowed roblox about worth throughout the month some as a christmas present and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card accept for this time i make kylee pay back half of the money well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail i find out she let kylee put her card on her iphone again and let kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged nobody said anything to me about this and now has been charged to grandma's card from apple because kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription after kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make kylee pay for the whole thing or only half but i don't know if i am going to make kylee pay her back at all i told grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but

allowed to use my husband's phone to play roblox with his sister we do limit screentime & the computer has some intense parental controls but my husband's phone doesn't have these because it's his phone however my husband was going through his phone a while back & saw some p*rnographic pictures on there that he'd not saved there was also a very inappropriate video posted onto my husband's youtube account that had gotten flagged & taken down it had a video of woman in the background & my son face fully exposed in the foreground singing some youtube meme song we went through the phone & the computer & discovered that somehow our son had managed to turn off the parental controls & was searching p*rn we cleared the history so we could tell if he did it again reinstated parental controls & had a talk with him every talk has been met with extreme emotions he's on the autism spectrum & has always dealt with intense emotions we have to take breaks in discussions to calm him down before we can continue so this conversation was met with a ton of tears even some yelling and insisting it wasn't him all he does is sob & yell that he didn't do it we know for a fact that it was him it couldn't have been literally anyone else we even caught him in the act because we'd wanted to make sure we weren't misplacing the blame we figured out that when he wanted to search something up he'd shut his door & try to be very quiet turn down the volume everything he could to be inconspicuous but since his doorknob broke months ago & we haven't bothered to replace it yet we can still see into his room & caught him red handed i need to know what else i can do the computer has been removed from his room & the only way he's allowed on my husband's phone is when he's supervised & playing roblox with his sister we also figured out that my husband's phone has a kids mode that will keep him from searching things he shouldn't my biggest concern is what's made him want to look this stuff up he's never been exposed to any of this as far as we know we're very careful about not exposing our kids to adult things literally the only time he's not supervised by us is when he's with my parents who are even more strict than we are & when he's on the bus for school our only theory is that he's hearing things he shouldn't on the bus because he for some reason despite being a tiny year old gets placed in the back of the bus where all of the highschool kids sit he hates sitting back there these kids have been bad influences before & helped him get into trouble he's fully responsible for his behavior but peer pressure is pretty rough i'm sorry i know i'm rambling i just need some advice on what to do here

my daughter has had a friend in her friend group since yrs old pre k she’s now yrs old they go to school together i’ve known this mother as a parent at the school we never became friends but i’ve always remained friendly i’m an involved parent volunteer at my daughters school know her teachers help with homework and overall have a great relationship with my daughter i’m a good mother but as she gets older i believe she needs to navigate her own friendships i’m always there to listen if she has an issue or needs advice but overall she has a nice little friend group they’re a good group of kids however there is one girl whose mother has become overly involved in her daughters life to the point it is beyond helicopter parenting it’s like she has inserted herself into the friend group it’s… kind of weird honestly for example our girls there’s in the group have a group chat where they talk play roblox together or just facetime chat together there’s always lots of giggling and my daughter will share with me funny comments or stories sometimes however it has come to my attention that this heli mom will read their chats listen in on their conversations etc and then proceed to message the other parents she’s never messaged me complaining about what she heard or read and how they need to talk to their daughters about their behavior another parent in the friend group brought this to my attention as she was confused and looked through the texts but saw nothing concerning this prompted me to talk to my daughter and ask to see her texts i would like to point out i believe in protecting privacy and i trust my daughter i would never look through messages unless out of concern such as this and she knows that so together she and i went though her group chat and i also saw nothing concerning it was chatting about school stupid funny memes and roblox this heli mom wouldn’t elaborate to the other mom except to say that our daughters weren’t being “good digital citizens”… like what i believe this woman is controlling and bored and has no life or friendships outside of her daughter and is therefore inserting herself into her daughters personal life and friendships the worst part is the child of this woman is very sweet and likable but her mother is making it impossible for her to have her own friends imo knowing that my daughters own privacy would be invaded if she stays friends with this girl i’m considering suggesting she spend less time with her and not chat with her outside of school i hate this as i feel it has forced me to invade in her friendships thoughts or feedback * the above example is one issue i was also recently informed by another parent in their friend group that they no longer allow their daughter to hang out with heli mom’s daughter bc of similar overly involved behavior by heli mom *edit this isn’t about internet access i know and understand the importance of monitoring what kids see and do online my daughter doesn’t have unfiltered or unlimited access to the internet it’s about this mother reading their group texts they had via their ipads my daughter doesn’t have a phone listening to their conversations and then i don’t know commenting on it like texting the other parents that they aren’t including her daughter enough in their conversations despite her daughter being included maybe her kid had nothing to say that sort of thing it’s like she sits with her daughter during their group texts or facetime and gets upset that the girls aren’t asking her daughter enough questions or something i don’t know
