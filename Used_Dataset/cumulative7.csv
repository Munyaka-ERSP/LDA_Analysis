r/roblox,"Concerned parents: Roblox scams, and cash grab games that pretty much force children to rebuy game packs they already own.
Ok, so the title says it all. I am sick of seeing all these games that are clearly a cash grab, and I have been blind to it until recently checking what my son has been begging for Robux for. Take for example Ninja Legends 2. These guys just put some shine on the original game and put a number 2 at the end of it. There is nothing new about the second game!! I just checked it myself on my sons tablet.

Why do the people who run Roblox let this stuff fly? Games like this only rename their original game and call it new so it forces children to re buy the same packs they already had, and the sad part is, many of these small children fall for it and beg their parents to buy them Robux to pay for something they already got..... its highway robbery. Something needs to be done about this soon. Roblox seems to be getting worse with all the Robux scams I need to constantly monitor that my kid is not falling for and now I have to make sure game creators are not ripping my kids off. I, and many parents in my community are going to start stepping up soon to try getting news out about this if something is not done soon. This stuff has to stop, and you need to stop letting people like this take advantage of children.

Edit: Forgot to add that I also play some games with my children on Roblox like Bee Swarm Simulator and a couple others, so this is how I know when I am seeing a scam, or something fishing going on.

UPDATE: Ok so I got what I needed from this thread, I will still stop in and reply once in a while, and I will just leave it here for people to discuss among themselves their experiences with games on the platform. People tell me I am wrong, but there is a reason this thread has so many up votes and support in the comments. Only people telling me im wrong are kids who like the game, or the studios goons they send to down vote and trash talk the thread. Parents are starting to remove their kids from the Roblox platform, and justly so. They are no longer a safe platform for children as they once were. When children are targets of greedy adults and corporations, it's time to do something about it!!",2021-01-06,1609913648.0
r/roblox,"Roblox (the corporation) doesn't exactly control the games on Roblox (the platform). They can moderate and remove games, but having excessive microtransactions is merely a bad practice and is nothing worthy to get a game removed, rather this is left up to the Roblox economy to decide.

[Anyways here's a link to a relevant topic by another Roblox game developer that you might be interested in](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/kq7k60/please_stop_with_the_simulators_are_bad_and_easy/)",2021-01-06,1609916801.0
r/roblox,"this is something i can agree with, its seriously BS. thing is, you can quite easily give people (who bought the 1st game's gamepasses) special perks in the new game (survive the disasters  1/2 for example, you get free gear in the newer game), so they can quite easily credit those who bought gamepasses for the first game, they just choose to ignore it because more sales = more money. pretty common trait in simulator games, the gamepasses are 100% optional, but they give such an insane advantage compared to other players, its eventually mandatory to buy them. Bubblegum Simulator is a prime target for this. 2x hatch speed, 2x luck, multi egg hatches, auto resource collect (totalling at around 2-3k robux). honestly such a disappointing turn for roblox games IMO. take this with a grain of salt since i've never played ninja legends 1 or 2, and probably dont plan on it.",2021-01-06,1609924976.0
r/roblox,Thats pretty much every simulator in a nutshell in roblox,2021-01-06,1609914162.0
r/roblox,"Basically...


All these ""simulator"" games are mostly the same thing. It is a business practice. Child play game, game get too hard, then they buy stuff for robux to make it easier. Like the other commenters said, there isn't much the staff at ROBLOX can do about it. It is, essentially, making ROBLOX money too, since there is a cut of the robux purchases made in games going to roblox staff, so maybe that is why they won't moderate these simulator cash grabs.

What can YOU do about it?

Not much. Teach your child that maybe these games aren't worth their time. Maybe help them survey the site and see any other interesting games your child might play. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you.

As for the sequel thingy:

As far as I have seen, this is a mildly rare occurance of repackaged games made sequels. So this is one of those rare occurrences, don't worry about that too much.",2021-01-06,1609926943.0
r/roblox,"This kind of thing has been happening since time immemorial. New things are released, old ones sunsetted, replacements needed, the wheel keeps turning. Players can spend tens or hundreds of hours playing these games so it's hard to label them cash grabs.

As for Robux scams; Roblox do what they can. All of these take place off site so Roblox has no real authority over them, they can block phrases and make it harder but the real power over the scammer comes down to educating your children not to fall for them.",2021-01-06,1609914611.0

r/roblox,"I’m a dev. Roblox literally incentives Pay2Win games. Roblox does not care that much for the quality of the gaming hemisphere or the site itself too much. As long as they are pulling in millions of dollars, “who cares if games are preying on little kids, it’s making us rich.”

I can’t even put the blame all on Roblox because they don’t make the games. I’ve been a player since 2011. The community had its faults then as it does now but it just wasn’t this bad or heartless. Biggest reason is because of the developer exchange. As great as it is. Now it’s kinda trash because the rates aren’t good but yeah it makes people want to generate as much robux as they can on their game just to cash out. Honestly sadly this type of bull crap only works on children. And Roblox didn’t originally market towards children until obviously the saw the profit potential.

There are still many games that are made for fun and aren’t pay 2 win. But it gets harder and harder to find if you aren’t an og of roblox or deep in the dev community.

I have nothing against making robux with your products. But I’m with you, some developers are just ripping people off and it’s so lame.",2021-01-06,1609946163.0

r/roblox,yeah the way roblox (mainly games and devs) has completely collapsed into what it is today really disappoints me and probably many others,2021-01-06,1609927729.0
r/roblox,"This is common practice in the game industry (from a consumers perspective). And stuff does get changed code wise and visual wise. It's just how sequels usually are executed. 

The same happens with FIFA, a less obvious but similar thing happens with assassin's creed and even GTA. Mechanics get changed but the core mechanics remain the same conceptual wise. It's what it is and there's little to change about it.

As for background info as to how I kno this, I myself am a roblox developer (programmer specifically) and work as a freelancer for several years now and am currently majoring in Game Development as an education, you can check me out under the name VoidedBlades. 

I'd just like to point out that these ""cash grabs"" are nothing more but a kid liking something and wanting to spend money on it, could even compare it to a person's hobby where they'd spend thousands of dollars on it. or even continuously buying lego for a kid as they love to play with it. However hobbies will usually change with time.

I just find it simply rude to claim that they just take the same game and rename it. A lot of work goes into reworking a game for a sequel even though a consumer might not directly see it.

Last but not least, we also need to make money to live. Roblox is our source of income despite it being an instable soure as income fluctuates heavily for a lot of developers.

And before assumptions are made. I do not create these type of games (I have contact with those who do and have had an in depth look on the genre and execution) as they don't lie within my range of interest.",2021-01-06,1609924690.0

r/roblox,"As a game developer, I agree that these kinds of monetization systems are EXTREMELY toxic, downright RADIOACTIVE. These ""Simulator""-type games are specifically engineered to draw kids in and take their money, their greed tarnishing the very reputation of Roblox game development in general. 

The game dev community is kinda split into two types of developers: Those who actually MAKE good games and those who make cash grabs to take people's money. I call them ""Makers"" and ""Takers"" respectively.

The best advice I can give is to teach your child that there's no shame in playing the original game, as sequels tend to be bad anyways; and try to find some other games with actual gameplay value, so ""simulator""-type games become boring to him.",2021-01-06,1609946656.0
r/roblox,"As a Roblox game developer I totally agree. A lot of games have really overpriced stuff and that makes it bad, even cash grab or scam games are really bad too. In my game, the best gamepasses to buy are under 100 robux so that it’s accessible for one with 1 dollar. I really don’t care about the robux, I only care about players experience :)",2021-01-06,1609970044.0
r/roblox,"Just having quickly hopped into both games and having a look around, I'd certainly say that from a developer of other games on this site and consumers perspectives that this game isn't anywhere near as bad as you're making it out to be, its obvious that a lot of effort has gone into new assets, interfaces, effects, etc. while you could argue the map layout is the same, I'd easily argue ""well if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". they have a map layout that works and is intuitive to players that have played the previous game(s).  


moving onto the statements about it using all of the same gamepasses/purchases:  
the only things I can see that are similar in terms of monetization between the two (granted I've only looked at their store tab on the website) are the things like perks. 2x storage, 2x collection, that kind of thing. I don't really see anything wrong here, almost all games have them, they're entirely optional and are only there to help speed up progression.  


in summary:  
at the end of the day, its entirely up to the developer(s) of that game to choose if they want to create a sequel based off the work that they've put into it. maybe there's just more they wanted to add to the second game that they couldn't do with the first due to technical limitations, maybe they just simply needed more money as you said. the developers of this game are people too and they need to make a living in order to pay for rent, food, etc. just like everyone else. in my opinion, saying otherwise is well, putting it politely, rather disrespectful of you.",2021-01-06,1609930560.0

If you really want to let your kid have Robux without ripping a hole in your wallet, install Google Opinion Rewards. It's a first party app by Google that's actually trustable. You answer questions related to you and other stuff, and it gives you Google play credit that expires within a year. You can spend this on anything in the Google play shop, I ncluding Robux.

Basically every game is made by users, (As I'm sure you know,) and the userbase/developers would complain if their game was taken down for ""scams,"" as technically it's not a scam, but in essence, it basically is. My solution is to not play those games, I know the issue is that your child probably only plays those games ... and I don't know what to do about it. As for robux spending ... I've only spent it on catalog items, clothing or in the select games in play that I adore. MOST simulator games are filled with those annoying/not very useful gamepasses.  

Now for actual scams: People have tried to scam me tons of times for robux, mainly by PMs on ROBLOX. They claim to be a ""User reporter,"" or something. I've watched tons of videos on those, and no you scammers cannot have my limiteds.

But I would like to stress that not all studios are like this, There are good developers on the platform that bring interesting and unique things to ROBLOX, it is a shame that there are some bad apples that give the platform a bad rep That plus the limits of the ROBLOX engine its self, And the fact that ROBLOX gives us pretty crappy exchange rates. Which can be the reason ROBLOX games have so many microtransactions (Though I don't defend these actions And Defiantly am against pay 2 win.) Best way to find good ROBLOX games for you and your child is to avoid the front page games, They are often the more clickily microtransaction games of the platform. Instead I'd recommend searching online for some ROBLOX games that fit you and your Childs favoured genre, There are a lot of YouTube videos on good ROBLOX games.

r/roblox,"I agree with you 100%. As a Roblox player since 2008, I have seen the change of Roblox turning more into a cash grab platform. If you did not know, back in the early days of Roblox there used to be a 2nd Roblox currency known as Tix. Every player got 10 Tix every day as a daily log-in reward and could get more Tix by place visits in which you got 1 Tix for every visitor. The user could of spent Tix to buy items in the catalog and could trade Tix for Robux using the **RoblEX** trade system. Sadly in 2016 Roblox removed Tix making everything now require Robux, this the where the modern-day problem that you have stated comes into effect. Sadly the people who run Roblox seem to not care anymore since now they make more money from people buying Robux. The only way to see if Roblox really wants to change this is if a Tix like system returns, which will sadly most likely never happen again.",2021-01-06,1609944390.0

I'd recommend the kids to play games that are original and not that too popular since jn my experience the buy with robux pop up rarely appear to me. Avoid if not be cautious on tycoon or any other simulator shenanigans they have a cesspool of scam items that doesnt do much and might be not permanent. Teach the kids to be wary on clicking things fast without hesitation this might slwp their progression on the game they'd chosen but its the safest way.
Clothes:
Shirts and pants are repetitive and sometimes too cheap or too expensive which can scam in anyway matter. Cheaps can be deleted just like mine, they tend to sell it at 5 robux and adds an eyecatching name and design. Same with the expensive ones. In my opinion they should buy at a group ad and game clothes market or buy originals at the origin.
Accessories are okay
Gear never buy them at all
Limited they are just collectors item which they resell or something idk why.

Lastly make sure the children never go to free robux sites without their acc having a pin and a verified email. They might not take your password but they can take your IP and might use it to their advantage. Some may actually give them robux but still its better to be safe than sorry.

r/roblox,"All of this, just for robux. Dang.

The value of robux compare to the US dollar is continuing inflating every time someone buys robux. The only reason why it hasn't inflated to the point of it being post WWI Germany is this thing called tax, where roblox (the corporation) receives 30% of all robux transaction and whenever someone buys a item created by roblox with robux. The only way of obtaining robux legally is buying roblox premium because it offers more then buying regular robux, but the pricing is expensive enough where someone can't just buy over 100,000 robux without spending $1,000 usd (only reason why someone would do this is if they are investing in limited items but that's another topic) but too expensive where you not really getting your money worth if you don't buy premium.

Anyways, all games die at some point, and some game devs milk the same cow. Trying to make as much robux without much more work. And with 30% tax on purchases that affects games dev robux income, they add new stuff, maybe change visual, mostly small changes, called it ""insert game name 2"" create the game, and milk the same cow to make robux. and because its a new game, the gamepass are incompatible. So if a dev makes a net total of 140k robux off the game, that's because 30% of the gross income gets taxes, which in this example 60k robux. (They can also exchange robux to USD on a special rate and on a special program called DevEX, but thats another topic. Obviously they can only exchange their net robux income made from the game)

I have no clue if the game devs are greedy but its a economic reason of why these things happen. Its it a good reason? Most likely not. Buts its a reason as regards to economics of roblox.

If a game dev really want to make robux and have a stable income is to just update their one game instead of creating a copy of it, slap a number on it, and call it a day.",2021-01-06,1609960463.0

Granted, I did have Roblox Premium Benefits, but I didn't spend any money on the game.

Also, the second Ninja Legends is cleaner and more challenging + interactive for users. I personally like the game a lot, and a lot of effort was put into the game, because it would take most people years to even create the map, but there is a lot of detail put into this game. It is a little bit pay to win, but every game has that aspect, no matter the size of the P2W.

r/roblox,"Roblox is a lot like the gaming industry, AAA games can be made annually, with some shine, and a new number. Pretty all of the sports games that are out are sequels with no changes other than graphics, roster, and a new number. Not all AAA companies have bad, P2W releases, though. But, if you take a look at smaller companies making indie games, they put a lot of effort into their style, and unique gameplay.

On Roblox, simulators don’t need to put any effort into their updates, and they’ll be popular. I don’t know how much effort it takes in order to produce their types of updates, so I can’t really judge them. But, they can release the same thing they did last update but with some remodels, and a different theme.

If you play a smaller game, or a game that’s made by a good group, updates/releases might take longer to come out but they have more quality to them, and they don’t feel as lazy as the larger games.

My personal recommendation for games on Roblox include:

[Arsenal](https://www.roblox.com/games/286090429/Arsenal) \- Fast-paced FPS with its main game mode being ‘gun game’ where you get a new gun every kill.

[Loomian Legacy](https://www.roblox.com/games/306964494/Holiday-Event-Loomian-Legacy?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Pokémon like gameplay.

[Welcome to Bloxburg](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) (paid access) - Build a house and roleplay with others.

[Vehicle Simulator ](https://www.roblox.com/games/171391948/2021-Vehicle-Simulator?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Unlike other simulators, you actually use a vehicle to drive around, and simulate something.

[Robeats!](https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212/feat-fusq-RoBeats-MMO-Rhythm-Game?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Vertical Scrolling Rhythm game, best rhythm game on Roblox in my opinion.

[Bad Business](https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-2-12?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Good FPS with really good, and fast movement.

[Outlaster](https://www.roblox.com/games/5343994291/Outlaster?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) or [Eviction Notice](https://www.roblox.com/games/2577040780/Eviction-Notice-BETA) \- Identical styles of gameplay where you play mini games, and vote out people in your team at the end of rounds.

[Iron Man Simulator 2 ](https://www.roblox.com/games/6097258548/Iron-Man-Simulator-2-BETA?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Simple controls and gameplay where you can use Iron Man suits.

[Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/2021-Gift-Horrific-Housing?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Stand on plates (with various game modes) and try to survive the events.

[Black Magic II](https://www.roblox.com/games/969669348/Black-Magic-II-RANKED?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- The most unique fighting game on Roblox, game play is kind of like Street Fighter, or Dragon Ball FighterZ.

[Anime Battle Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/1458767429/HOLIDAY-Anime-Battle-Arena) \- Fight using anime characters, the gameplay is more simple compared to Black Magic II.

[SARB](https://www.roblox.com/games/5848360485/SARB) \- Super Smash Bros. like gameplay but it's in 3D.

[Doomspire Brickbattle](https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- A game from the older Roblox, but remastered to fit Roblox's new physics, and engine (I don't know if that's the right word for it).

[Tower Defense Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Tower defense gameplay like Kingdom Rush, and Bloons, where you try to protect a location by placing units.

[World of Magic](https://www.roblox.com/games/3272915504/World-of-Magic?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Open world game, with a magic combat system, and your actions affect the world.",2021-01-06,1609967665.0

Here’s the silver-lining, kids who got scammed got a taste of the real world; scams don’t just happen on Roblox or online. They will learn how to be skeptical and understand when something is too good to be true.

Honestly parents with this overprotective mindset is just hurting them in the long run. Kids need to learn how the Internet works, their own action have consequences and experience the world by themselves, if they fuck up they will learn through their mistakes. I definitely fell for scams, got trolled and bullied on the internet when I was younger. I’m in my early twenties now; I turned out fine.

Then I tarted checking the game passes that my son wanted. Not only are there the same ones from the first Ninja Legends, but they added new ones to scrape a little more money from our pockets....

The Roblox platform itself has become corrupted and something needs to be done about it. Once I have gathered enough information and testimonials I plan to take a crack at gaining ground on them. They will change for the better or the public will change it for them.,2021-01-06,1609969719.0
r/roblox,"They made a second game that is in all aspects the same as the first game. I rolled around it for a while. Most of the passes are the same. That you can't fool me on. The area layout is 100% the same, the bosses has a new paint job and as for the interface. How does that make my kids or myself re buy game passes. I don't care how many upset developers come here cringing and thinking ""Better say something to defend this type of behavior"" is wrong. Again, what makes it worse is they mostly target children with this. I have also confirmed a few minutes ago that the developers are indeed paying YouTubers to advertise this clone. This is 100% a scheme to make more money, but their making A LOT more then an average person, so rent food and what not is not the problem.

It astonishes me that people see nothing wrong with this. You can't take old things, toss a number 2 on it and brand it a sequel. Would you watch a movie that had the same scenes, from the same actors, acting out the same things they did from the first movie? Lets take the movie Star Wars for example? Would you watch the death start being destroyed twice by the same weapons, by the same people? Would that make any sense? Or how about if a video game you often played copy and paste EVERYTHING from their first game and sold it to you as a new game? Would you pay for and play the same thing twice?",2021-01-06,1609924194.0

Take for example the YouTubers being payed to falsely tell children how great and amazing the game is, how they buy the passes on stream or video showing them how powerful it makes their character.

Scamming would be an illegal act of swindling someone out of their money for nothing (of equal value in return) or not getting what's stated when bought, which in this case they are getting. If not it's a violation of roblox's ToU. The value here is determined by the creator and stated when bought so the upper hand lies with them.

I have yet to make an informative post about scamming matters in terms of how they work as I've previously have given an in depth informative post on the devforums about cookie logging and several commonly executed scam attempts attached to it and how to prevent it from happening to yourself.

Don't get me wrong. A reupload of a previously created game (if they own the intellectual property) is morally wrong but legally not, if it would be companies like EA would be in major trouble with their 3rd reupload of the exact same game.

As I said previously, this is not ""in all aspects the same"" their new game has new (and not to mention higher quality) models, effects, artwork, animations, etc. just because the layout of the map is the same, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with it, it means that was the one aspect of the game they decided to bring over in order to make things intuitive to returning players. its not a criminal offense.

TIX was removed because when it was a thing, new players automatically got a certain amount of TIX (I don't know how much since it's been so many years but I'm guessing 20). You can also exchange a certain amount of TIX for exactly 1 Robux (again it's been years, so I don't know how much but I think you needed 100 TIX). So, the smart kids and adults used this to their advantage and spammed accounts and bought things that their main account made, which would usually be a shitty T-Shirt that costed TIX. The main account would get tons of TIX to exchange for Robux and the alt accounts would be left in the darkness. So, ROBLOX didn't remove it just because it wasn't making them money; they were actually losing money and the economy was being ruined.

You've talked about the real world in some of your other comments. Why not kill two birds with one stone and teach him how to deal with scams, peer pressure and the like using Roblox? It's a valuable life skill. That's all I'm saying.

I was once a child. I know what it's like with this kind of stuff, and I'm glad my parents taught me how to deal with stuff like this. (Not saying you are a bad parent.)

I'm not defending these practices, I just think this rant of yours is sort of useless because nothings going to change for two reasons: A), Roblox won't care, and B) The games aren't explicity breaking any rules. They shouldn't be taken down for ""scamming"" because they technically aren't and that would lead to bad precedent for the rest of roblox's games. Kind of like a vague rule which could technically be used to take down any game roblox admins dont' want around. That example is a exaggeration but I hope you get what I mean.

Again, no one is being forced to do stuff here. Manipulation != forced, and that's why I think these games shouldn't be taken down. As addicting a game is, as manipulative a youtuber is, at the end of the line, you're choosing to spend that money, that robux, and your time. You have to learn how to control it and think through it. Hard stuff to teach to a kid, I know, but now's a good time as any to start. (Besides... can't you just outright deny him the robux?

So all the content, specifically cosmetics, are earnable. Most are locked either way, behind methods of finding them/earning them, but the ones you can purchase are bought through what we call Hypercoin.

The Hypercoin is earnable, found through lucky spawns, completing contracts, drops from bosses or even enemies, and daily rewards.

r/roblox,"I understand your concern and of other parents within this thread. Sadly that snowballing has already been happening for years within that genre as it's to keep generating profit, there's no benefit in doing this on roblox's end as they'll lose valuable profit (their value has already been falling) nor is there anything legally that I can think of that'll make this happen.

This is something that seems uncontrollable from a consumer's perspective other than disallowing their children to spend Robux on the games that do that. 

Regardless, striving for such a change isn't bad whatsoever. It just seems out of reach in my eyes, which leaves the responsibility at the parents/guardians.

We're talking about a platform on the internet that has a main focus on having content generated for money after all. The internet is a scary place and can cause a lot of damage in a small time if treated without caution. That caution is usually one's own responsibility or of their parents/guardians.

One thing I do know is that this has only happened so far in the Roblox simulator genre (correct me if you've seen games in other genres do this) which is a current trend but should soon or later die out, just like any other trend on roblox, due to how it has been milked.",2021-01-06,1609946759.0

r/roblox,"Please, stop with the assumptions. I read your edit up in the post (not the comments) and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a Roblox shill or a 7 year old kid. That really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you, as you're opinion's already been made. 

I'm not sure if you know this, but Roblox does not make the games. All of Roblox's content is completely player made. (Well, with the exception of some events and tutorial games. Heck, the whole point of Roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games.) What does this mean?

Any multiplayer game has the danger of Adults and susceptible children meeting. It's not a new thing. Usually, the multiplayer game has safeguards, such as safe chat, child friendly mode, or whatever. But in the end, it's ultimately up to YOU to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online. The game can only do so much.

It's almost the same in Roblox's case. These are multiplayer interactions between players to players. People playing other player's games. Not player to company. You see, that's the huge difference. They can't be held accountable in the same ways. 

I hope you understand that I'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason, not because I only read a few sentences of your comments. The solution is with YOU guys, not the other way around. 

Look, I understand that these practices are quite shitty. But there's a real difference between actual scams and these ""scams"". I've seen games get taken down for real scams. For instance, you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t-shirt. That's a real, bonifide scam. Meanwhile, with your case, you're getting what you pay for. Sure, the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated. But the gamepass never promised how long the game would last, did it? Scummy, but legal. These practices are NOT criminal, despite how close they may seem. Taking action against things like these leave a HUGE precedent and could be damaging for all of Roblox. 

Let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of. Where does the solution lie? That's right, with YOU. Your son is choosing to play these games, and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform. He is choosing to play these scammy games, despite there being tons of other games out there. Issues that are out of his control, like nudity, swearing, etc, that is the type of stuff Roblox is trying to prevent. 

""Children should NEVER EVER be taken advantage of by adults."" I agree, but its the goddamn INTERNET. It never ever will be safe. Like, c'mon. If your child can't handle Roblox, maybe it's not the company's fault. It's not Roblox's job on how to teach your kid 21st century skills. They do what they can, but when it comes to issues born out of free-will, what the hell are they supposed to do? Your kid WANTS to buy this stuff, and if it's due to manipulation and targeting, then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit. As long as free speech exists, manipulation will too. Connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities. You know that.

If you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff, then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing Roblox. If you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids, then good for you. You're making the choices here.

I wish there was some sort of way to counteract scamming more than just them saying to be careful. My daughter and I have played for years, her more than me. And for the first time, she got scammed, bad. Her whole entire pet collection in Adopt Me. My hands went to my face the moment she mentioned her whole pet collection for 100k diamonds in Royale High. I gotta say tho, the scammer went as far as meeting up in royale high and starting trade, putting the 100k diamonds in, then waiting till the last second to bail. Said it was getting late and theyd do it again in the morning. They met her in the morning and tried again then promised after school. Well, they unfriended her. And her heart broke and I felt so bad for her. Me personally, I wouldn't bite if someone offers me all them diamonds for my entire pet collection. But she did it. And even though I have their username and account name I feel it's so pointless to try anything. And I mean really what is there. Reporting won't get her stuff back either.

r/roblox,"It's unfortunate to hear that your sons were tricked but I suppose it's better for them to learn this lesson now than later. In regards to your question, [I recommend contacting the roblox customer service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313390-My-Account-was-Hacked-What-do-I-do-) if you are unable to recover via email. It's important to note though that ~~if~~ the customer service representative working with you approves your sons' accounts for a restoration (such as if items/robux were taken out of the accounts), they will only do so once for an account; this means that if either of your sons' accounts are compromised in the future, regardless of losing a significant amount more or less of items/robux, they will be ineligible for an item/robux restoration (they will however be eligible for assistance in retrieving a compromised account). Likewise, customer support has a 14-day limit on item/currency restorations. Although the link doesn't explicitly mention this, users on this subreddit have reported past successes in recovering accounts if they made purchases on them - with this in mind, I recommend keeping your payment information on standby but not providing anything unless asked. I hope that this helps!

r/roblox,"Roblox games on Xbox can use A button to scam players out of robux
Twice recently my daughter lost Robux unexpectedly playing a game on the Xbox version. After doing some research, it appears to be down to specifically how the Xbox version of Roblox maps controller buttons. By default, I believe the A button is mapped to Jump & Confirm. So when a dialog pops up, e.g. Purchase this in game item, the A button is used to confirm the purchase.

When a game (like an Obby) makes a lot of use of Jump and also includes in-game purchases, this creates a situation where accidental purchases are super easy. So easy that while my daughter was carefully trying to show me what happened, without triggering the purchases, she accidentally triggered the purchase.

I've reached out to Roblox customer support about this and so far they've been extremely unhelpful. Their position is summarised as:

* They can't (or won't) refund robux
* Issues in games are the developers responsibility
* Developers can't refund robux
* Tell the developer because we're sure they'd want to fix it

I don't believe this is a developer issue though if the default for games on Xbox has the A button mapped to two operations. Maybe a developer could remap, I don't know as I'm not a Roblox dev, but regardless, this is very much a Roblox issue and one they should address (and refund on).

[https://twitter.com/wideawakewesley/status/1348700550142054400](https://twitter.com/wideawakewesley/status/1348700550142054400)

Here's another great example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQyMcVH8LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQyMcVH8LM)

r/roblox,"Interesting.  Roblox could fix this by adding a second confirmation on Xbox in which ""A"" defaults to cancel, or by having a one to two second wait period before you confirm.  That being said, a developer could address this by not giving you a purchase prompt while you are in a situation in which you would normally be jumping. 

 In a situation like you described, the developer probably has not thought about that being an issue, since you would not have the same problem on PC.  

The scary thing about this, is that it could be used to scam Xbox players.  Maybe if you mentioned your concerns regarding that to Roblox, they may implement some kind of confirmation.",2021-01-14,1610645684.0

Forgive me if I don't get alll the terminology correct here as I don't play the game.

My 11 year old daughter has been playing  roblox for quite a while and from what I can tell has built herself up a decent account. Recently someone scammed her somehow by stealing some sort of legendary rideable flyable neon dragon and some various other animals she had collected . She was devastated. We talked about password safety and scammers. Today she came Out bawling saying someone scammed her during something called a trust trade?

This person promised her a bunch of stuff for her rideable dragon but from what I gather, the person took the dragon and left the server.

Is there anything I can do to help her get this stuff back? I emailed roblox a while back about the first incident and they couldn't garuntee her stuff being reinstated and it doesn't look like its going to be.

r/roblox,"Oh... I'm sorry for you're daughter and her lost things. I assume that the game is the certain: Adopt Me! game? I don't think there is anyway to get her stuff back but some tips for you're daughter:

Never Trust anyone that you don't know in real life.

Don't do trust trades! 99% of the time it's a scam.

Don't give out a password to someone when they guarantee free stuff.

Don't buy other perks from other games telling they'll guarantee you that item in another game.

Trade stuff that are the same value.

Whenever trading, write down the user's name so if they leave, you can report them to the owner of the game or Roblox Support.

My little girl loves Roblox, she's autistic and sometimes I'm able to get her to do things is to bribe (five bucks to have her let a hair stylist touch her is worth it.)

The past three days (July 2nd, July 3rd, and July 4th) we have been out of town with no access to her account. When we got back she immediately hoped on her account only to go into full meltdown, after an hour of calming her down, I discovered the issue.

The 275 robux she's had when left had dissappeared, replaced by a Pepino mouse shirt now worth 185 robux, purchased July 3rd when she had no access to her account, nor did anyone else.

How could this have happened? She is terrified she has been hacked, but why would a hacker just purchase a shirt?

When I didn't find a refund button and did some googling, I realised the chances of her getting refunded were unlikely, so I offered to buy her robux to replace the lost ones, but she insists it's pointless to have robux if her account is hacked.

Thanks to a YouTuber (I forget which, maybe itsfunneh?) she knows how to avoid the common scams and has even instructed me on how to as well. 

Any help with what could have happened and how I can reassure her her account is sfae now that I've changed the password?

I'm also confused how the hacker could of gotten her password? I am the only one who knows it, I didn't tell her.",2018-07-06,1530843768.0
r/roblox,"Hi - welcome to the sub.

There's a few possibilities, but here's a guess.

1. Her account password was weak and it got guessed.

2. She downloaded something that 'keylogged' her password.

3. Possibly she knew the password and accidentally fell for a phishing scam?(This is unlikely by what you stated, but I'm leaving this as a possibility.)

___

First of all, I highly recommend you to set up security settings on her account.


**Enable Two Factor Authentication** - https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-2-Step-Verification-Information 

**PIN** - Through [settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/security), you can enable a separate PIN inside of your account settings to prevent unwanted changes to your account settings.

**More secure password** - Secure passwords are difficult to guess, have long lengths with mixes of capital letters and uncommon keys(e.g @#$%^*&). You can also use a [password manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/877c10/looking_for_password_manager_recommendations/) to handle your passwords for both your Roblox account and other sites.

**Never give away your account details.** - There is almost no situation where you can reasonably give away your account details. Roblox staff will never need access to your account. Always check frequently when clicking links whether you are on the official Roblox website(www.roblox.com) before entering any account details.

**Beware of off-site downloads** - Off site downloads can contain malicious content which steals your account details. Be wary when downloading anything from untrusted sources, especially sketchy forums promising 'free' or 'paid' cheats/hacks for games. This includes browser extensions.

___

Aside from that, Roblox has a ton of security options that should prevent this in the future. Above are the examples(2FA, PIN, etc) which would make it much easier. There's also an option on the settings to log out anyone that isn't your device/computer in the settings panel.

You can also contact roblox support for help -  https://roblox.com/support

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. We get a lot of parents on the sub who are confused on what to do, and most of us are happy to help.

r/roblox,"It's very likely that you have a keylogger on your computer. Uninstall suspicious software, if you have to run virus scans (dont download virus scanning software though) use windows defender. Then change the password and enable two step verification. This will force you to have to enter a text code that's sent to you by email every time your child logs in, or every thirty days depending on which setting you pick. Once you've updated all account info report the owner of the shirt on site and email roblox support including that users username. Once the message is sent to support it may take around 12 hours to get feedback however it's very likely that your child will get the robux back.

r/roblox,"Hello there,

Something like this has happened to me before.

On the 4th of July, 2018, my Roblox account was hacked by someone unknown. They purchased Robux on my account (I knew that because when I checked my Robux, the balance was up to 123 to 943). Later on, I accessed Roblox again and saw that my account was deleted for unauthorized/disputed charges. I emailed Roblox Support as quick as possible. Some hours later, I received a reply saying that my appeal has been sent to a billing specialist who will be able to assist me further.

After 6 days of waiting, I finally received a reply from a billing specialist saying that my appeal has been denied. When I read the message, I was completely clueless since ”one or more of the purchases made to this account were reported as disputed/unauthorized by the card owner through Google Play.“ 

I had absolutely no idea what that meant since the card holder is clearly me. What I assumed happened is that the hacker purchased Robux on my account with a different card so Roblox saw the charges is unauthorized and terminated my account. 

The question is... How did they assume such a strong password? The hacker could have possibly keylogged my Roblox account. After some weeks later, I finally received another message from Roblox saying that my account has been unbanned. Later on, I activated 2 step verificafion so something like this won’t happen again.

I also forgot to mention that the hacker left a message on my account. ”This is what you get.“",2018-08-16,1534411354.0

The game is really a bad game due to the fact that it constantly pushes microtransactions onto the player and it's literally pay to win. want to know how it forces microtransactions? it forces them for example there is a way to get some things without paying, but you have to go through hell and back just to get these things for free. for example free pet slots. for example op pets. with the merchant update, it makes it worse because you have no choice but to spend your Robux on diamonds because it's not really like you can get 14 m just by grinding in the game. it really evident they just want your money because of ven the smallest things like the boosts costing Robux, and the dark matter pet queue. Now, want to know how its pay to win? it is pay to win because of the fact that the game is not enjoyable and someone wouldn't willingly spend money on it because the game is basically ""you don't wanna spend money? okay, then you'll have to work through hell to earn it."" and because being a new player makes it really hard to play the game for free because if takes you at least a few weeks to get ""op pets"" while if you spent money on the game, you would gt there in little to no time. not to mention that the dev of the game Involved nfts in a children's game/game that targets kids. this shows how hungry for money he is. and he sold those stupid plushies unlicensed as well and they are a terrible way of receiving codes as it is very easy for someone to buy these and literally cut the code off of the plush or already use it and then they sell it to someone not knowing that that person used the code.

And this is how you advance in Pet Simulator X. If you enjoy the game and you spend money it will speed you up but the pets that you can buy for Robux are way worse than the free pets that you hatch in the game. 

I can see how if you aren't very smart, you are very young, or just don't understand the concept of AFK grinding you may think that this game is Pay to Win.

""a big scam"". a big scam? really? a scam is when you are lured into spending robux on something that isn't worth it. the things you can spend robux on are all somewhat worth it, and it isn't requiring you to make a purchase if you don't want to. if you don't like the game, or you don't want to spend robux on it, don't play it? don't spend robux on it? it's really not that hard just to leave it alone, as some people like me really enjoy the game.

Because you need to pay for huge cats and huge stuff? Then huge pumpkin cat, You can't even buy it. So it isn't that bad. I played and I know how it's like. You don't need to buy to get a scam tho?

Exclusives can be bought using gems.

Gems can be obtained from other players or just grind an gems based team.

r/roblox,"it still is. the game takes advantage of kids epically when the Christmas egg was released he changed the price to 1200 when he could have left it at 800. and to even get through the game quickly you have to spend money. a free to play a player who doesn't buy anything to grind for pets would keep struggling to get ""op"" pets after every update, but a p2w player would have gotten through the whole game within a day. the game forces you to go through so much to get one pet slot, and then as you keep unlocking them becomes hard to obtain certain pets like ones that cost Robux, and the plushies as well. another problem was the release of the in-game merchant that would sell pets at extremely expensive prices and the banks as well. when the game first came out you were forced to walk back and forth if you didn't wanna buy the tp thing but that got changed. then the merchant update. people were upset about it because of how expensive the pets would be and not everyone is able to get diamonds quickly. the banks' update is extremely horrendous. i had grinded to get to 7mil to buy it and then when I did buy it, after looking around, the next teir is  FOURTY MILLION diamonds. that was terrible pricing as people cannot afford that much and some people ant even auto farm for that much, and a lot of people such as myself either had 1 mil or just had nothing left after buying the bank. another big problem with the game is how Preston fails to show people what his game really does contain. so many people were disappointed at either the game itself or at least one of the updates because they always got overhyped. another problem is that kids were legit wasting Robux on this game by buying things become ALOT of the children's  side cant afford Robux like that or arent allowed to get it alot either",2022-01-12,1642016015.0

lol, and it kinda seems like you are angry but I'm speaking the truth abt the game. its as bad as Preston's other pet sims. they were all cash-grabs. also remember his audience the game caters to is mostly of kids who have no idea what they could be doing. you should let people have their own opinions on the game. he's just as bad as his own game is. he was so down bad for money he involved nfts in the game. a Roblox game that caters to children",2021-12-03,1638571888.0

It is interesting but people who are below 16- likely don't get what it is since it is complicated topic. Hell, even 18+ has some troubles understanding it. Developers on Roblox tend to do whatever they want with their game, but roblox rules exists and you cannot break the rule in the big way.

 Also, I don't think he has forward oriented thought if he didn't expect big backlash and hire a PR team before proceeding to do it. It is very obvious. It is not smart and hurt other developer as roblox take a stricter stance on 3rd party selling after incident. Developer used to use patreon for ingame benefit and he alone completely ruined it.

The point of adding something isnt to teach the player. Its just because the developer wanted to add it for their own sake. Why you think players would want to inform themselves on behind the scene mechanics idk.

Roblox rules are created to not disrupt community experiences. Roblox rules are enforced by Roblox. At their own discretion. It’s why they allow certain things even if it’s against the ToS. It’s not automatically invoked. It’s meant to be enforced. If the developers ever get in trouble though, you can bet your ass they will use this against them as well.

Roblox having to hire a PR team is a sign of clear ignorance on the loud minority tbh. PR teams aren’t made to create logic and reasoning, they’re there to create false comfort.

Not at the expense of other developers. There are a lot of reasons to open 3rd party store even in a non NFT way but no one did it as they know it would a big no no for Roblox and likely stricting up the enforcement. Similar things happen for Epic Games vs Apple, I don't get why people think it is smart and ""forward thinking"" to  bypass limitation given the lawsuit.

>Why you think players would want to inform themselves on behind the scene mechanics idk.

>Roblox rules are created to not disrupt community experiences. 

Parents behind players would be freaked out if they see NFT up to $1000 without understanding anything.  They would make unreasonable demand disregard to the community.

> If the developers ever get in trouble though

Yes, by releasing NFT for a big game when majority of community didn't understand it. Developers did patron in low profile for same reason. Now developers are scared since roblox said they enforce it more due to NFT incident.  

> Stop informing yourself by reading intetnet trolls and posts and actually look up what blockchain is.

As I haven’t actually seen the NFT yet, i wouldnt know how its valued currently, but not every NFT is going to sell for more than $100. NFT doesn’t mean expensive. Most art piece NFTs only sell for around $40 USD. Lol as if parents freaking out over something they have an option to purchase is a good excuse for a developer to not explore and maintain their game as they wish. Stop fearing the unknown and creating scenarios in your head that haven’t happened. Its not a good argument against anything to say “well, i think people are going to just automotive self destruct once they see something I know nothing of”. 


NFTs is just a new way to sell/buy virtual content with lower fees. A marketplace. You don’t have to understand how it works to use it.

r/roblox,"> do you understand why the whole Apple vs Epic Games is a perfect example of why blockchain is necessary? 

Roblox, Apple or any private entity would still enforce the rules even you sell it as NFT. Changing payment method to cryto -> NFT has the same implication as changing payment method to your own (which happened for Apple vs Epic), you could still get rule enforced on you. They enforce on creators which Blockchain doesn't protect on. 

> As I haven’t actually seen the NFT yet, i wouldnt know how its valued currently, but not every NFT is going to sell for more than $100. NFT doesn’t mean expensive. 

They're now for gaming items as people speculative investing on NFT for metaverse things. The NFT pet in pet simulator costed 19000 USD at one point. Gaming items could high price hold true even it is even not NFT, looks at Pet simulator plushies. NFT pushes it to very unreasonable price.

> Stop fearing the unknown and creating scenarios in your head that haven’t happened. 

I think developers feared creating 3rd party store very openly would make roblox stricted up enforcing was true.

> NFTs is just a new way to sell/buy virtual content with lower fees. A marketplace. 

It is true and I already know, but not relevant when the roblox could just ban you off platform so the item hold no value when the game (thus ""assets"" themselves) doesn't exist, unless pretrson makes pet simulator standalone.

r/roblox,"Story about why you shouldn't let your kids create anything in Roblox Studio
What follows is a moderation story. I am pretty sure appeals is never going to get back to us with anything useful so I mainly want to share this so others don't end up in a similar situation.

At first I was just planning on posting up the very frustrating appeals emails with Roblox support but I am not sure it would be helpful. It seems it is well known that the appeals system is broken and not in place to assist users. Instead I am just going to post up about what led to my kids account being banned. Hopefully this can serve to prevent other young peeps from having a similar situation happen to them.

My 7 year old has been playing Roblox for a number of years and absolutely loves it, we enjoy the freedom she has by being able to play a huge number of game types in one place and she even recently started to try her shot at making her own games. She watched a Youtuber create a clone of Adopt Me and wanted to try it herself (danger zone). At the time I was unaware that this was against the ToS as there are innumerable such games all over Roblox. I imagined it would be a good way to get a feel for game creation and provide further ideas for how she might want to create her own games.

She found some resources in Roblox Studio from Adopt Me (danger zone 2) and whipped out a quick game. At the time I thought nothing of it, after all if what she was doing was a problem why would there be so many games that looked just like the popular ones.

A couple days after publishing her game she goes to her computer and it says her account has been banned. Specifically for ""creating a phishing game designed to scam other players"". I can assure you she has no idea what phishing is (now she does because I had to define it for her, so I guess the learning is a silver lining), she only knows what scamming is in terms of what she should look for when someone is trying to get her to do something wrong.

She was devastated. Not only was her account banned, but for a reason she didn't even understand. She does extra chores for Robux and invests real time and effort into the platform. Now she is not sure if she ever wants to put in the same effort again, and I don't blame her. After being hit with a capricious ban she doesn't even want to open Roblox Studio for the fear that what she might do could get her new account banned. Every time she goes to play an old favorite she has that halting realization that all the time she put into it was wasted and the Robux she used to get VIP is completely gone. She tries to pretend like it's not a big deal but each time she tries something she used to do she gets real quiet and sad.

I tried to get more information from the appeals system as to exactly what she did that was considered phishing or scamming. At best by looking here and in the DevForums I believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it, without official confirmation this is complete conjecture. Appeals was unwilling to give me any actual useful information and has ghosted us on responses after the first few that were obvious form letters. I mainly don't understand how it moved to immediate ban and kangaroo court appeals. There is no room to grow or understand.

I am greatly disappointed in Roblox, a platform I had previously recommended heavily to friends and their kids, but it has let us down immensely. This disappointment is compounded even further by not having any useful, official channel to resolve grievances. Literally the only thing I can do is post here on Reddit, which is, at best, just so I can say to my daughter that I tried everything I could think of. Maybe I'll wait for the IPO, buy a share and go complain at an investors meeting. I sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else as it was a fairly traumatic (to a 7 year old).

TL;DR Be very careful about letting your kids use Roblox Studio as it may lead to bans for offenses they do not understand and you will not receive justification for. Also be careful what you let you kids copy from Youtube.

GIANT IMPORTANT FOLLOW UP:  After all the super useful information here I put in one last hail mary email to appeals about the free models containing malicious code and how it was unfair to expect a child to understand those dangers.  Just got a response from appeals and they changed her ban to a warning, which I honestly did not expect at all.  For anyone else in a similar situation I highly recommend persevering while also being unfailingly polite.  While the end result is a win I still feel Roblox needs to improve their customer service.  I am just glad that at least some of my faith in Roblox as an entity has been restored.",2021-01-29,1611923788.0
r/roblox,"Yeah, it sucks but Roblox be Roblox. It's support is garbage and the playerbase has already known it for years.

&#x200B;

One thing I'll explain though :

\> I believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it, without official confirmation this is complete conjecture

You're right but kind of not, people like to add scripts into free models in the Toolbox section of the program that do stuff like pop up a store item that's worth X amount of Robux which will be stolen, redirect you to a phishing game or something similar which may steal accounts, passwords or Robux. It's not a backdoor, it's a script that's designed to do a malicious thing.

There's a reason the Roblox community says to never use the Toolbox because of this, but I understand that your kid is a kid, so according to them it was innocent fun. The Roblox Studio program is truly a great and creative thing and you should let her use it, but warn her that she shouldn't use player-made models in risk that the account may be marked as phishing/scamming and terminated.",2021-01-29,1611925665.0
r/roblox,"You could help her by giving her tutorials on how to model, script, ect. You can make some great things just NEVER use the toolbox as half the items in there, if put in your game, will get you banned almost instantly. There are some tutorials on how to clean models and get the malicious scripts out IF you want to use the toolbox.",2021-01-29,1611929428.0
r/roblox,"Something like this can be really discouraging.  Hopefully your daughter doesn't give up - that's the worst thing that can happen.

If she found resources that actually belonged to another game, and if she designed the game to be a clone of another game, that may be why she got the ban.  Especially if she ever got around to adding in purchases.  If I remember correctly, Roblox has sometimes had an issue with people ripping popular games, and then trying to get people to make purchases on their game rather than the actual one.  This would count as a scam, since people would buy the item on the fake game, expecting that they were getting it for the real game (seems like I read about this somewhere, sadly I can't seem to find a link to it at this time).  Unfortunately, I'm not the Roblox appeals team, and I can't tell you why they did what they did, or why you did not get an adequate response.

In all likelihood, somebody probably reported the game.  This could explain why Roblox gave your daughter's game specific attention rather than some other clone.  From their perspective, somebody just said that a game tried to scam them, and while looking at it they realize that it looks like a clone of a popular game.

I would like to just mention (and you probably already know this) that as long as you're following the ToS (make sure everything is your IP, no bad content) you shouldn't have to worry about a ban.  That doesn't rule out the chance of moderators making a horrible mistake, but it is unlikely.

All I can really say though, is that I'm sorry that this happened to your daughter.  But most of all, don't let one bad experience cause you to give up!

r/roblox,"This sucks, it seems like some stupid bans have been happening within the last while. one actually had the same ban reason yet the developer was not even trying to do that. and this was a well known dev or someone that's been doing this for a while.

I find it a bit harsh, sure there are people who do, do that kind of thing, with places that you do into and it makes it seem like its a way to get free robux etc, and asks for your account info. those type of people need to be banned on the spot... however for things like this and im sure it may happen more then often, they really need to up their moderation and actually look into things. I'm not sure if its automated or done in person, but things like this should be a warning, like say one warning and if its done again then a ban.

hope she gains back her courage, and presses on start with building and get good with that, then as she gets a little older maybe start scripting. I'm primarily a builder on the platform, been building since 2013, at first builds might look simple but as you go, you get better and develop techniques and your own style.

As for scripting, I would recommend not following tutorials on how to make something, and focus on the fundamentals of it first, then after you get a understanding, then go and try the tutorials, but start off with simple things.

A good Youtube scripting playlist for beginners that is more up to date and one I had started to follow within the past year some is AlvinBlox's 2020 beginner scripting series [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTth8CE\_os8sog72YTMLPhDSf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTth8CE_os8sog72YTMLPhDSf)

Another Person you can check out is DevKing [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ)

There are more good people on youtube who do scripting tutorials look around, different people will have different things they cover.

Another good resource would be the Official Roblox Developer Hub, [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/) it has different guides and references. If and when she gets to a point where she is getting into advanced things the API references or in general is a good way to see what different things are for and how to use them when scripting or building

Like others said, its best if you avoid the toolbox, only use it for audio, plugins (make sure the plugins are legit ones), Skyboxes etc.

Good luck, would be nice if this got to Roblox some how and they were able to properly recover your daughters account, because not only does it suck because whatever she may have worked on is gone, but all the items and game progress.

r/roblox,"I mean, it's probably albert (flamingo) that she watched, I feel bad, but y'know, I guess in the end, I'm sorry to be really harsh but I guess roblox can do what they want, and technically you did break their ToS. I mean, if she sold gamepasses for robux (which she probably didn't do) I could understand why they'd ban her, but since she probably was just trying to mess around a bit, it's kind of up for a moral debate about whether they should've banned her. But I do encourage for you to try and get her to find her interest in roblox once again, and try and use this as a lesson. Teach her about ToS, I have a 4 year old roblox account, if I lost everything, the hours I've played, it would definitely suck. I'm just glad she didn't loose 4 or more years of progress.

r/roblox,"I mean yeah, that is the lesson learned.  I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that a model that you can select from a default option in the Studio should not contain viruses and scripts that can lead to your account being banned.  It's not like she was sideloading models from a shady warez website.  It is literally a button right at the top.  

Expecting them to make sure there are no malicious resources loaded into their own system is not an unreasonable assumption, especially for a system designed for a younger audience.  If any piece of business software had resources with that kind of possible dangerous exposure they would have been sued out of existence a long time ago.  

I have a fine tuned danger meter for things from the internet, I watched her build the thing and at no time did I think what she was doing could have been dangerous.  It was a piece of tribal knowledge.  Even just a pop up that says ""resources from the Toolbox may contain malicious artifacts"" or something to that nature would have been the bare minimum and would have certainly prevented this from happening.

This is a platform for children and teens primarily and the gating that Roblox has put around their tools is shockingly terrible.  It is further compounded by an obviously paper thin moderation process.  If it is true that the ban was a result of a model loaded from the Toolbox (which appeals refuses to comment on) it is absurd to move directly to a ban, especially with zero warnings.  Those warnings could be in the form of the aforementioned popup on creation or a first time offense warning.

r/roblox,"Do you remember when Adopt Me was a game where you actually adopted and took care of a baby?
I do, there was no pets or trading and many people were happy and were roleplaying. 

I roleplayed with my friends at times in adopt me and we pretended we were some big happy family. 

Now, I don't even play anymore because it's kind of boring and dislike it. In my opinion, there's not much to do that doesn't involve having to spend money or have a chance to be scammed. It's barely a roleplay game anymore, since most of the chats are for trade requests. (ABC IF YOU HAVE A DOLPHIN YOUR WILLING TO TRADE!!!) 

When you do get into a family, it seems not much like a roleplay still. The thing you are adopting isn't a child, but a pet that costs money. The pets can be potentially scammed and spend a lot of money to buy certain features (fly and ride permanently). To get certain pets you have to pay extra robux which in my opinion seems to always be overpriced.

I did some research and found out this same group ""groups major lead game"" has done this to many others.  Ive emailed and called support and am awaiting a response.  Is there any chance he gets his robux back?  If not, what is the point of even purchasing robux if they can be stolen at any time?

I know almost nothing about this so any feedback would be appreciated.",2017-09-03,1504397767.0
r/roblox,"While I'm not roblox staff, I'll try to answer some of your questions.

**Is there any chance he gets his robux back?** - Yes, if you contact Roblox support fast enough. Usually they'll be able to do it(but only once) as long as it's done within a certain timeframe(14 days).

**If not, what is the point of even purchasing robux if they can be stolen at any time?** - It cannot be stolen at any time. Your son made a mistake by trusting a stranger and giving away either his access codes(password, pin, etc) through a phishing site or bluntly stating it out to them, downloading something that contained a virus, or having an easily guessable password and not having two-factor authentication or anything of the sort enabled.

**And how do they allow these scammers on their game to steal from kids?** - They do not, but it's a game of cat and mouse. Many online games/game platforms tend to have people who want to scam, because there's typically someone who's scummy enough to do so. Roblox has a large younger playerbase who plays games on their site, so it typically tends to be much easier for them to do so there(as much as I like to say a lot of children can be smart, there's plenty of them who are gullible for things. Maybe it's the santa claus argument again.) 

Roblox has made an effort already to make it harder and harder for the scammers(they've removed the entire commentary section on games because scammers were spamming it 24/7. They've hid the serverlists recently so that the scammers have a harder time getting the names of everyone to send messages to/friend requests to, and so on. But no matter what, as long as there is valuable currency at stake, scammers will be active.

Roblox is a game platform at the moment which has a MASSIVE playerbase, and there's so many games on the site that they cannot moderate them all, since players themselves are the ones who develop the games. I'm assuming your son most likely entered his details either through a site that looked much like a real roblox site(phishing), through a in-game place that he was linked to, or through any of the previous stated.

Anyway, sorry about what happened.

r/roblox,"Adopt Me is the worst aspects of modern gaming
I've been watching my 10 year old niece play Roblox for a few months. Last week I decided to install it and play it with her to figure out exactly what it is all about.

Wow, this is worse than what people complain about EA/Activision games, and I don't understand why people aren't calling this child exploitation or raising pitch forks.

Grinding -> You spend your entire time micromanaging your pet (and/or baby) so you can earn currency to buy things. There's a constant list of things to buy (bigger houses, vehicles, eggs, etc). Want a neon pet? You have to grind 4 of the same pets and combine them. It's a big grind fest and the primary thing people trade ingame are pets for other pets & vehicles.

Loot Crates -> Eggs, Gift Boxes, etc. that have a posted % chance of getting rare items. Everyone wants Legendary items which have a 2-8% chance on most things. Have fun grinding for an hour or two only to get a common pet.

Micro Transactions -> Want a permanent pet fly/ride potion, rare pets, more faces, better houses, cars, wings, etc? Bust out your wallet. You're constantly spammed with things to buy as soon as you log on.

Prices -> Things are deliberately priced so that you have to buy more currency than you require. Example: a pet might cost 1000 robux, but you can only buy 800 ($9.99) or 1700 ($19.99) robux at a time.

Pay 2 Win -> Want to skip the grind? Bust out your wallet and dump $40-100 to get everything you need.",2020-07-16,1594917102.0

I hate how much microtransactions they put in their games, because they are making tons of money from sales of the games, advertising, events that promote the games all around the world.

Roblox developers earn money via DevEx, which means they exchange the robux made from their game, to real money. Sadly, only way to do this, is put bunch of shit kids will want to buy in your games, so if you want to make living from being a ROBLOX developer, this is the only way. You can also make your game pay to enter, but those dont get as much traffic. There's only two games that have made some headlines while being paid (eventho it's like 20 cents to enter) - Apocalypse Rising 2 and Welcome To Bloxburg.

Adopt Me is free to enter, like 99% of the games made on Roblox. The only way for the developers to earn cash, is by microtransactions and gamepasses. While I completely disagree with exploiting children with all these pets and passes, it's nowhere different from other games, where there is lootcrates etc.

r/roblox,"I agree, most roblox games are grindy or pay 2 win and I dislike that. I get it that these people are trying to earn money and I heard some people are using roblox to pay their rent but some of these are for kids! There trying to make kids buy the things in the game. This web/app is mainly for kids and I know there are adults playing but just because 1 adult is playing doesn't mean everyone is an adult. I wish Tix was still a thing so poor people doesn't have to spend money, I mean, ROBLOX has alot of people playing so why do they have to worry that they can't make enough money? There is over millions of people playing and most of them will spend money to buy robux so why worry that they won't make ebough money?",2020-07-17,1594946102.0

r/roblox,"Yeah and it's hella annoying when you're trying to do a trade but nobody takes it seriously.

It's also annoying when you're trying to look after a decent pet that you own (I have a regular dragon) and people swarm you like flies, then they just spam you with trades because you forgot to disable trades.

Although it's fun to troll like forcing people to sit down even though you've never met or just stealing a kid and dropping it in water.",2020-07-17,1594954090.0

r/roblox,"i agree with every point, though it can be fun messing around with kids or breaking the game over your knee and building in the void. though without friends to do that stuff adopt me is just a shitty cash grab of a game, like simulators. i dont find how kids like it, you do pretty much fuck all and have to spend forever just to try and get 1 crate, or you spend your hard earned cash and gain basically nothing. in konekos video i saw that as soon as he joined the game he was advertised a very expensive gamepass and later in it he saw a crate that was R$ only and having it being R$ only little kids will spend a bunch of money to try and get the rarest pet.",2020-07-17,1594981793.0
r/roblox,"Isn't gambling like 1 of roblox's rules? Because the kids are basically gambling. Now I'm not saying all kids will spend robux on bucks then they waste it all and sometimes don't get their desired item. It sucks how big of a game Adopt me is, and I doubt Roblox would care because that means money to them and more players.

r/roblox,"I'm tired of seeing people criticizing Adopt Me for pay to win. All paying does is just give you more money on which you buy pets or customizing your house (but lets be honest pets are a waste literally no one cares about them). Personally, I think that if you want to skip the grind and get right into building, I mean, I don't see the problem. While your not understanding why no one's raising pitchforks, I'm not understanding why your niece is so irresponsible.

A fake trade request pops up and then pictures of high-tier pets will appear. The victim will then ""accept"" the trade, and a second pop up will prompt the victim to enter their username and password to ""verify"" something.

Anyways, after the victim puts in their password the standard scam stuff happens, all of the Robux on the account gets drained, and then the account is used to make more scam games to steal more passwords and more Robux, sort of like a pyramid scheme.

r/roblox,"Personally, in my opinion, DevEX is what actually made Roblox worse (for me). Here are some of my thoughts:

* DevEX could be the root cause of clothing spam bots. Before DevEX, Robux was just an in-game only token with no real world value. Now that Robux is worth real money with DevEX, people have more motivation than ever to exploit the flawed system. Talented people have spent time making these bots and fight to keep them running. There wouldn't be real life benefit to clothes botting if Robux didn't have real value.
* While DevEX can reward great developers, it does motivate some devs into optimizing their game for maximum profit, sometimes by using bad monetization tactics like those that OP mentioned. Games are more likely to be more of the same, with big colorful ""Shop"" button as if Shop is the #1 button players want to interact the most with. Or a timer pressuring me to buy the limited time Starter Pack when I first played a game before I even know if the game is going to be enjoyable for me or if the pack is really a good value.
* While DevEX let people do things they enjoy, it could also attract profit-driven tycoons who only cares about profit who make game just because money.
* Before DevEX, one-person made games at least have some chance of getting to the Front Pages. Now that there are professional teams and studios that are formed to make everything more efficient, one-person games have practically a little chance; No longer that side projects made just for fun can get popular, ""Use money to make money"" now apply even if you don't intend to earn money.
* Optimizing to appeal to the most player as possible can result in monoculture in the long term. Games can become more bland and/or more of the same overtime.

Look at the DevHunt 2019 and 2020 (some could argue even 2015); so many participating games are absolutely optimized to the max for maximum profits and play-time without considering players' enjoyment while also putting in as little effort and creativity it as possible. Some even used psychological tricks to get you to buy things. (Roblox could do better in quality control, but I think if DevEX isn't here these DevHunts could be at least a bit more bearable)

Now, I understand that there's no going back now as much as I want them to. People have already made Roblox Development their main job, and I absolutely do not want to ruin anyone's living on this planet Earth. Changes of the DevEX kind is simply irreversible, and I understand it. I'm not protesting for DevEX to be removed, I just want to express my thoughts.

This is just my opinion, I can be wrong, but things like this have at least for me, ruined YouTube in the recent years; now that people have taken YouTube as a job.  Many have to obey ""the Algorithm"" just to make a rent.  Many censor themselves because they don't want to risk being demonetized.  Videos that should be shorter are stretched to \~10 min. for maximum ad revenue.  Clickbait are used to lure in the most views.  Some creators sacrifice quality just to pump out new videos every day.  Then there are tycoons churning out inappropriate and uncreative cartoons because they're lured in by money.  Some now even openly admits to using clickbait after being called out, but ultimately shrugged it as ""It's just business"".  Yes, Roblox and YouTube is not the same, but DevEX have already made an impact, for better or for worse. It seems everything is all about money now, and I mean only and purely about money.

And yes, this monetization schemes did bring more production value to both Roblox games and YouTube videos, but I find that it's getting harder to find enjoyable Roblox games or YouTube videos that respect my time after these schemes take place. For me, production value doesn't always mean it's going to be enjoyable.

I'm also very sorry for the long reply. These are just my opinion.",2020-07-17,1595009315.0

I can still remember days where you could get daily free Tix currency for just logging in to the site. You can use that currency to buy some clothes to customize your avatar and buy stuff on Roblox games. That free currency was removed not long after Roblox went mainstream and new leadership take place.

Games on Roblox back then also don't have flashy color, big ""Shop"" button and terrible monetization tactics, because you can't exchange Robux for real money like you can now (which led to the terrible profit-first design like you see in Adopt Me).

""Guest"" feature was intended for parents to try out Roblox before they allow their child to play it without giving information and create a Roblox account. That was also removed from Roblox after new leadership take place.

r/roblox,"I spent 4 hours there and only got about 100 robux from it. Why? Because all the rich people are donating to other rich people. Someone with 100k donated to someone that had almost 1m donated to them already. Rich people get richer. 

I actually need Robux to fund for a game I want to make and try not to beg. Instead I just stand at my booth, occasionally asking people with more money but mostly just staying on my stand and dancing or something. But I almost never get donations. It... sucks. Someone who actually needs it isn't getting anything, but someone that already has tons of money is getting loaded with Robux.

I want to make a 20th anniversary game for Roblox, but I don't have nearly enough money irl to just buy 200 dollars worth of Robux. So I need to rely on others to help.. which never happens.

I've been playing for about 3 days and still only have 143 robux raised, in comparison to the rich people who constantly get donations. It makes me feel ashamed of not having money IRL or in an online game.",2024-01-26,1706304617.0

one day her son came up to her and asked to put in the password for the account. she thought he logged himself out but apparently some youtuber was scamming him. unfortunately my cousin put in the password and their account was gone.

When we say that the game is written in C++, all that means is C++ is the programming language that the game was written in. It is the same thing as a book from Germany is written in German. Computers speak languages just like people do and each one is different.

A game engine is a bit more complex and difficult to explain, but it's essentially the software environment that the game runs and is created in. It is the backbone of the game.

r/roblox,"Question about Robux usage in game
My son plays, I don’t, though I’m a bigger gamer than he is. So I’m at a loss on how Robux works in some games or if there’s a way to contact devs and was hoping someone can help. My son on several occasions has been upset that he used his Robux then went back to the game and the thing he bought he no longer has access to (abilities, gear, etc.). That in turn frustrates me because we pay real money obviously for the Robux, then to find out once he’s logged out and back in he’s lost it, I almost wonder if some of these games are scams that you pay and lose whatever you paid for. Does that happen? Can they get you to pay Robux and the item is only good for that one session? Is there really no way to contact devs for support on their titles?",2019-06-11,1560278295.0
r/roblox,"I think the easiest way to explain it is Roblox isn't a game on its own, but rather similar to Steam where it hosts a ton of games made by independent developers. 'Robux' is basically used as a middle-man currency to purchase stuff in different games.

Let's say there are two games - Phantom Forces and Apocalypse Rising. Both have their own 'ingame' currency that they use, which is purchasable with Robux. Neither have any direct connection as far as I'm aware of, so nothing purchased in one game works in the other.

For gears, there are a lot of stuff that you can purchase on Roblox's official catalog. **This is purely cosmetic** - most if not nearly every game on the platform does not support Roblox's own official gears because it wouldn't work with their games well/they have little control over the balance of it.

And yeah, there are some games on the site(they disappear fairly quickly though) that show up as scams. Generally it's easy to tell for the average user(giant screen-blocking microtransactions everywhere and generally poor quality games), but for a kid not so much unfortunately.

There are some games that have items specifically only for one session. Usually they'll specify it in their descriptions before someone purchases the item.

Some devs have twitters(usually they block off their mail on the Roblox site since they tend to get swarmed with mail if they open it up) that you can reach out to them, or discords.

I've recently grown interest in checking out the stuff that I did back in 2014 when I had my old Roblox account.

-If it's a game, it will show a static picture or video- but 1050 robux is way too high to buy access to a game. You can redirect him on a different game and he might be able to buy ""powerups"" there, or get access to a way cheaper game.

-If it's a user, that's a scam. Tell him to never give Robux to someone else unless he expects to get nothing in return.

Wow, how things have changed. I don’t even know where to begin. At first I was hesitant to return as I’ve heard negative things, so I didn’t want to ruin my memory of the fun times I had, but they were hella wrong. At first I noticed there weren’t any guests, which was quite saddening but I get the reasoning. So I went to go make an account. The amount of usernames that were taken is absurd, then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least. But after like a half hour I finally got in. The front page pretty much looked the same. It didn’t have my classic red R but that’s okay lol. I didn’t know what to play as there were tones of games, but then I found murder mystery 2. I’m glad murder mystery games were still around so I clicked it. At first it was pretty normal, lobby, spectate and the shop. Then I went into the back room and figured out you could vote which was pretty neat (i don’t remember if they had that before). Besides that it felt a bit small but was pretty great. Other people in the lobby were dripped out, there was even a Coca Cola lady. Which was actually really cool. We load in to a game with this hotel type map. I got innocent. Which was expected lol. Anyways I noticed coins on the ground so I picked those everyone I saw up with out really worrying about the murderer. I didn’t realize there were so many hiding spots. Then I get earraped by this dude with a boombox on his back. You think for the hardcore censorship roblox does now, they would fix that. Anyways I heard a gunshot then we loaded back up into the lobby. We won :D. I went to the shop to see what I could buy with my coins then I realized you need to play for awhile just to get a knife. I went back to the front  page. I saw this game called adopt me was on popular so I decided to play it. I loaded in to this dope menu. They asked me if I want to become a baby or adult so I chose adult cause why not. I went into the tutorial and the amount of customization is insane. I left my house with this cool animation. Then a arrow is pointing me to a white wall. I go in then there is this beautiful hub.  Lots of stuff to do, I was overwhelmed. I make it to the middle which I was surrounded with stuff to buy. Then I got a pop up to buy this and that but a lot of it was Robux. I felt like I was in the middle of a Indian tech scam. Anyways I make it inside to adopt a child. Turns out no children were able to be adopted. But It didn’t bother me because I was to busy looking at all the cool animations.

r/roblox,"Can I recommend some games that you can play without using a lot of robux?

If you like fighting games, maybe try a game called Super Doomspire (it is one of my favorite games :)",2021-03-15,1615842360.0
r/roblox,"Adopt Me is the most popular game on Roblox. (Partly because it's got like a whole team of developers who add stuff all the time.) And just to clarify, everyone there is obsessed almost to insanity about the pets. No one cares about the actual ""adopt a baby"" part. Basically the amount of robux you spend determines your popularity there, and the rarer the pet too. It's actually a really fun game though it's roleplay, but it can get crazy from all the beggars and constant bragging in the chat.

And here are some games I like (and many others like too):

Jailbreak - A pretty cool two-teamed game, where you can be a criminal or a cop. It has many things you can do, but more choice when you're a criminal.

Tower of Hell - I ***do*** like it, I really do, though many people get really frustrated by it. (Which I can *definitely* confirm.) Basically, it's a randomly generated tower of obbies, and you have a time limit to get to the top. And yeah, it's more fun than it sounds.

Piggy - A horror-styled puzzle game, where there is a ""piggy"" who needs to kill all the players before they escape the map. And the sound effects make it like 10x spookier.

Flicker - I know it's not too popular, but Flicker is a spooky-ish mafia styled game where everyone gets a role, either good or bad, and needs to vanquish the other team. (eg. if I were the murder, I'd need to eliminate the good team with my evil teammates to win.)

Anyway, I'm happy for you. Roblox is a good game though considered childish, and it's also a tool for game creation and even moneymaking. And yes, it *has* evolved. You should search up ""rthro"".

Edit: Rthro might seem creepy at first, but trust me, it's only in the face.",2021-03-16,1615856283.0

r/roblox,"Roblox account constantly being hacked
My boys both love playing roblox.  But their accounts are getting hacked, someone is stealing their robux and just generally ruining this game experience for them. I've told them to quit playing because it's pretty obvious that administration doesn't give two shits about account security. But they love this game. 
  
What are they doing or not doing that is allowing this to continue to happen? My son's account was hacked last night, changed his password, ruined one of the groups he built. Last week someone took ""donated"" all of their robux. Wtf?",2016-09-11,1473604286.0
r/roblox,"The only way to gain access to someone's account on Roblox is by directly receiving the users password from the user. 

In other words, there is absolutely no way to hack the Roblox Website and get access to a random players password.

Some if the ways this ""hacker"" gets access to the account are:

•Phishing: They make a scam website usually promising to give free items in game and requiring to log in with the player's Login Info on their website. This basically means the player was fooled to directly give the ""hacker"" his Info.

•Becoming friends with the player thru the inter-web or in real life and asking for Login Info

•Player accidentally reveals Login Info

•There is malware in the players computer, usually caused by clicking unknown links, that has a keylogger (records each one of the player keystrokes)

Hence said, the only way a ""hacker"" can gain access to your boys' accounts are by directly receiving their Login info. ",2016-09-11,1473605747.0
r/roblox,"For the account:
Find and wipe any possible malicious programs that can use your computer to get around logging in on their end. Then once again reset all passwords (roblox AND email)

And for the group, do you mean the attacker donated all robux to a group or wiped all funds from a group? ",2016-09-11,1473605418.0
r/roblox,"I'd suggest sitting down and talking with the two of them and just asking a few questions, make sure they know they are not in trouble, and its just to help understand how things are happening.
- Ask if they have been messaged by anyone saying they can get Free Robux, or been sent any other links.
- Ask if they have read any comments and visited sites mentioned.
- Ask if they have told anyone else their passwords, and if they've not, ask if they've changed their passwords after its been hacked to something very different.

After that, you should know if they need a little bit more internet savvy, or if there is another problem.
As suggested, do a virus scan, ESPECIALLY if they haven't done anything of the above. 

Out of interest, may I grab the names of the accounts? I'm not a crazy hacker dw, but it may be worth checking google to see if they have landed in any ""password folder"" type sites.",2016-09-11,1473607149.0
r/roblox,"I'm sorry, but the admins give a fking sht despite all the sht we give them on the roblox subreddit.

100% they gave away their passwords or have a really simple password.

First option -please press the 'log out of all other sessions' button, and change the password. Both are in the settings of the account.

Add an email with a different password. If it is already verified then secure that email.

Email  the roblox info email(on our sidebar). Give them proof that the account belongs to x person(roblox card id numbers, credit card info used, etc.)",2016-09-11,1473608777.0

Not to say new games aren't incredibly well made or still enjoyable as hell, they just dont feel the same anymore in the current atmosphere of roblox. The games which ""appeal"" to an older audience just exist for youtubers to make bad jokes or for edgy kids to mess around on when they probably shouldn't.",2020-12-07,1607367045.0

Reason why people spend money on fortnite and actually play it is because they offer a quality free service that is easy to understand, and actually has micro-transactions that do not give you an advantage whatsoever, and are just cosmetics that are fun with a battle pass that has decent shit in it (i.e. Family Guy Collab). You can enjoy the game to the max, even with free cosmetics they give for achieving quests. It's great

i'm really sick of all the clones that try to be like fortnite but their greed and lack of understanding of why people like fortnite better is hilarious. I know people who only will play fortnite or minecraft purely because of the ease of access and focus on, you know, making it fucking fun. I stick with single player mostly now, and it's insane to me how a studio like santa monica can give out a whole quality story DLC for GOW ragnarok, and then meanwhile COD released mw3 for 70$ which feels like it was DLC for mw2.

You build up villages throughout the map, recruiting NPC travelers to become villagers, and you can assign them jobs to do.  There is crafting in the game, to craft things like:  crafting tools, weapons, crafting stations/machinery, food, and more.

r/robloxparents,"Child labour..? I wouldn't call it that.... The children who do make games aren't being exploited... At least in a way that's completely unethical. Roblox started off as a method for people to make games easily and share them with others, and while Roblox has changed over the years, that core aspect is still there. Most younger people that make games there are not in it for money or fame, they just wanna have fun, make games, and let people enjoy them. It only becomes serious when that game has potential to make a good amount of money. That's where some questionable things come into question. But the people that make these kinds of games are almost always full-on studios, that have no children in them.

Roblox is extremely money-hungry, they make useless brand deals with brands that have nothing to offer the platform, they cancel events that the entire community loved because it doesn't make a profit, they revive old event items and sell them for absurd prices, they show favouritism towards people that make them money and are willing to ban those who don't if they do even the slightest thing wrong. They are, if I may say, corrupt. 

But the games the community makes are great. Its like YouTube, anything that isn't related to the company is amazing, the people, the communities, the games, the culture. It's why people stay on YouTube even though they are also rotten to the core. They both offer something special that can't really be found elsewhere.

r/robloxparents,"well i'm not sure where i stand on this issue, as while Roblox's actions are quite predatory towards developers, seeing as they take most of the revenue, though at the same time, people who develop roblox games volunteer to do so. They are not employees for Roblox which leads to the divide, Taking the majority shares of profits, while detestable and a bit abusive, is still technically not illegal since developers use Roblox on their own volition, then again, some developers are too young to make such decisions, the missing piece is intent, which we will never know. after all, Roblox claims that they only provide the tools, you use them. Roblox is not right, but they are not malicious. calling them malicious is an gross overstatement. and i disagree with People Make Games there.

>well i'm not sure where i stand on this issue, as while Roblox's actions are quite predatory towards developers, seeing as they take most of the revenue, though at the same time, people who develop roblox games volunteer to do so. They are not employees for Roblox which leads to the divide, Taking the majority shares of profits, while detestable and a bit abusive, is still technically not illegal since developers use Roblox on their own volition, then again, some developers are too young to make such decisions, the missing piece is intent, which we will never know. after all, Roblox claims that they only provide the tools, you use them. Roblox is not right, but they are not malicious. calling them malicious is an gross overstatement. and i disagree with People Make Games there.

These are your words. You are defending the company based on the “legality” of the situation. You continue to point out the technicality rather than the morality of the issue at hand.

I don't know where you get those facts from though, I've seen this shit happen to my old GPUs, a 9500GT and a GT 610. One of them went kaput after the cooler got stuck and it overheated, it worked the next day but was full of purple/smeared textures and models. Only 2D applications worked, really. The other GPU was a fanless model but the design was so shitty that it was able to jump to 80C on YouTube when it was brand spanking new and had similar artifacting to the first GPU (also the PC was different so it couldn't have been the CPU/mobo/RAM), I had to ""extend"" the fins by putting some random metals onto it like dead HDD cases and radiators taken from dead PSUs.

We are long past that point. We've solved that problem. We know how to let you ask in plain English how to do something and whether it's possible.

I'm not arguing that parents should have no responsibility - I firmly believe that controlling interactions with potentially harmful things is part of the job of a parent.

What was ""unsafe"" here? The mother gave the kid money, the kid spent the money, the mother regrets the kid spending the money. There's no issue of safety here.

> We put safety warning labels on them

And yet people are also saying the parents shouldn't have to read the instructions or look up what's safe and what isn't. Do you think there's no safety warning when you enroll your credit card on your ipad telling you that you're committing to purchases? Do you think the T&C doesn't say purchases aren't refundable? Oh, right, you don't expect people to read the agreements they agree to.

> It's called regulation

We *have* those regulations for this case. It consists of ""don't authorize your card to be used for purchases to which you don't agree."" I'm not sure why you're describing this like it's a safety issue. The mom gave the kid a credit card. The kid spent a bunch of money on the credit card. The mom regrets giving the kid the credit card. Where's the safety problem? Why are you equating that to buildings collapsing or food poisoning?

Please explain what unsafe events occurred because of roblox having an all-purchases-final clause in their T&C?

Or, putting it a different way, please point to the regulations that say McD's has to give your money back if you buy a hamburger and then decide you don't want it.

> I also believe that if you market something as kid friendly or kid safe

I don't believe credit cards nor iPads are marketed that way.

The problem was not roblox. The problem was the credit card used to purchase roblox. Roblox didn't hurt the child and wasn't dangerous to the child or anyone else. The problem here is the parent handed their credit card to their child and turned them loose in a toy store, and then the parent was surprised that the child bought toys. What do you suggest as a rule to prevent children from using their parent's credit card to buy toys that isn't already supported by both society and the machinery in place?

And if I wrote the number on a piece of paper and handed it to someone, I didn't give them the card, right? Yes, the card was saved on the iPad, and she handed the iPad to the kid, and she didn't prevent the person she handed the iPad holding the card from using the card. I bet when she put the card into the machine, it asked her how she wanted to protect it, whether she wanted to have to put in a PIN or a fingerprint or something, and described the problems that would come from not having a lock on it. (Android certainly does.)

> no different to the kid taking the card from her wallet when she was sleeping or something

And what do you suggest as the solution to this problem? Other than being vigilant and/or teaching the kid to not do that? Shall we put regulations on wallet manufacturers?

She can afford an $800 iPad. $2500 isn't going to fuck up her life. It's a painful lesson, but better than letting the kid drive your car into the side of your house.

> Why is a kids game even capable of taking £2500 without that flagging up alerts like a Christmas tree? 

How do you know it didn't? I bet it asked if the kid was authorized to make the purchase, too. Where would you have the alerts displayed? On the inside of Mom's eyelids? 

If she is paying so little attention to what's displayed in the instructions that she doesn't know whether the kid can use the credit card online, what makes you think she'd notice alerts? You already said she's too ignorant or lazy to bother to check whether she can prevent her kid from using the card, so why would she be looking for alerts? You can't have it both ways.

> Why should taking thousands of pounds for in-game stuff in a game aimed squarely at children be unregulated and all the blame be laid on the parent?

Because that's contract law and not tort law. Because the parent agreed to let the kid buy that stuff, but she just didn't realize it, because she didn't read the instructions. It *is* regulated, quite heavily. It just requires someone to pay attention.

Nothing revolutionary, or expensive, or restricting the rights of adults to fritter their money away however they choose.

They're not the same sort of danger as collapsing buildings or food poisoning. Not every mistake is a ""danger"" we must regulate against.

I'm not. I've asked repeatedly what more you would expect. Every device I've ever used offers you at the time of setting up the payment system the ability to require a PIN for every purchase. I am not against such restrictions. I'm against mandating it to the point where stupid people still couldn't screw up.

This is an app store that already has all of your personal details, including your credit card details and your email address. It would take adding a single API to the standard toolkit to make this work without revealing any info to the app itself.

Given we see this kind of story frequently in the news, this is not a one-off problem. It should be a regulation at this point because we clearly can't trust companies to voluntarily behave.

As for a dollar amount, I'd set it around the price of a full-fat game, so £70. 

I'd say the kid having to open a separate program entirely adds enough extra difficulty and friction to put the blame on the kid. Theres a difference between deliberate action and just clicking accept blindly on the popups in your game.

There are never 100% foolproof answers, but we don't say there is no point regulating anything - we accept that regulation is *risk reduction* and that's worth having.

> If you don't think putting a PIN on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable, why would you think putting a PIN on the email account is reasonable?

Because I'd expect my email to have non-kid-friendly info in it, but wouldn't necessarily expect a kids game to be able to charge thousands of pounds? 

Want an example from an earlier age of tech? It used to be common for kids TV shows to have call in contests on premium rate numbers. This obviously caused unexpected bills, as parents weren't used to guarding the phone - it had never been an issue before because the premium rate services were all targetted at adults.

>  I've asked repeatedly what more you would expect

 When have you asked me specifically?  And somehow I doubt this woman's device asked for a pin every time the kid made a transaction, considering he spent thousands.

> What makes you think iPads don't tell you the risks of putting your credit card on the machine when you put it on the machine? 

Because it's Apple, and they typically concentrate on making a setup process quick rather than informative. What make you think they do clearly tell customers the risks?  Can you show me where in the process of setting up an Ipad that those risks are clearly displayed to the user?  Keep in mind that I said clearly, none of this Vorgon shit where the plans where kept on display in a locked filing cabinet in a disused bathroom with a sign up front saying 'Beware the Leapoard""

Really I'm not asking for much.  Make it clear during the setup of any card on a device the risks in doing so.  Example: In adding this card to your device you are allowing any users to make charges to your account.  Click yes if you acknowledge this risk.  Also make a password required for every charge made, and that password needs to be separate from the devices pin.

And finally this should be obvious, but when something is obviously a kid's product there should be a limit on how much someone can buy in a short amount of time without the account owner being notified and needing to approve the charge.

I've never claimed there's no point in regulating anything. I claimed that we already have regulations and we already have mechanisms in place.

> shows were forced to say ""remember to get the bill payers permission before making a call"" 

But that's already there. You can already put a PIN on your card, or not put your card in at all. 

You can also turn on ""Ask To Buy"" apparently: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203025

I'm not sure what that does in detail, but it sure seems like you can globally require any child account to get permission.

No. I don't use apple products. But if you think putting your card on the machine and *not* being asked for a PIN of any sort is safe, then you're a stupid person. If all you're asking for is ""offer when storing the card to protect it with a PIN"" then I'd agree that's quite reasonable.

No, I'm quite clearly saying the kid bought the toys, but isn't to blame if it is deliberately made excessively easy. The level of blame shifts as more obstacles are overcome to make the purchase.

All of the suggestions you've put forward are *things you have to switch on*. Mine are *things you have to switch off*. That's the difference.

You can't have it both ways. You can't say she wasn't responsible and also that she had to pay. You can't say this happens frequently but she shouldn't have known about it.

> caps that you can opt to disable (on by default) plus an email if you hit a reasonable limit.

That doesn't sound unreasonable. I fear for the slippery slope, though. And I'd imagine emailed receipts are already a thing, so I'm not sure what the email only after you hit a limit would be.

I'd be happy with ""entering a payment vehicle requires you to choose what level of protection it gets."" I.e., it can't default to ""you can just use it without a PIN or fingerprint or etc."" You have to deliberately select one of the options before proceeding.

Also, if you didn't authorize it, charge it back.

Now a regulation I *would* approve of is that companies cannot cancel digital stuff you paid for just because you charge back something you don't want to pay for. If you buy five games, and the sixth one is bought by someone else, you shouldn't lose the first five because you charged back the sixth one.

I'm also rather disturbed at the trend of ""I fucked up, nobody is rescuing me, so I'm going to make a big stink until someone else solves my problem for me.""  I think that too is a dangerous trend that's only going to bode ill for society.  (Now, if it was someone else that fucked up and they won't fix it, sure.)

Then there would be no excuse that you gave it to your kid without knowing it. Requiring certain kinds of purchases to get confirmation even when the company doesn't know it's a kid is problematic. And requiring the confirmation when the company knows it's a kid is already built in. 

Share the password to your finances with irresponsible people, win stupid prizes.

If there was a way for evolution to solve stupidity, it would have already found it. It found a way to solve ignorance, but not stupidity.

> Reputational damage would be one reason

That's why I find the trend of ""we did everything right we were supposed to, but you're calling us evil because you're too stupid to understand what's going on"" very distressing.",2023-05-23,1684870504.0
r/robloxparents,"> She should be issuing a chargeback claiming she didn't authorize the purchase.

Did you read the article? She did. They refused until the news got involved, at which point suddenly they issued the refund and compensation for the hassle. Publicity was absolutely required, but that isn't something that everyone should have to do - regulation would mean it wouldn't get to that point.

> emailed receipts are already a thing

Surprisingly uncommon actually - I think the only online service I've used that has emailed receipts is Lord of the Rings Online.

> I'd be happy with ""entering a payment vehicle requires you to choose what level of protection it gets."" I.e., it can't default to ""you can just use it without a PIN or fingerprint or etc."" You have to deliberately select one of the options before proceeding.

That seems reasonable, yes.

> Now a regulation I would approve of is that companies cannot cancel digital stuff you paid for just because you charge back something you don't want to pay for. If you buy five games, and the sixth one is bought by someone else, you shouldn't lose the first five because you charged back the sixth one.

100% agree - Blizzard are terrible for that shit.

> You want these restrictions to only apply to kid's games? How about movies? Candy? Random other crap on the internet?

If you market to kids, yes, I'd want those regs. If some kind of VR tech comes along as an alternative to cinemas that lets you order film-based tat (posters, models, whatever) within the experience then absolutely apply the same rules. If your kid randomly orders physical goods like candy or toys from the internet, it's already covered under distance selling legislation - you can send it back for any reason for free within a certain window for a full refund.

> Share the password to your finances with irresponsible people, win stupid prizes.

To be fair, if you live with a kid it's pretty challenging to keep secrecy. It isn't like an office, your coworker is unlikely to be sat in your lap :)",2023-05-23,1684872657.0
r/robloxparents,"> Did you read the article? She did. 

OK, I read it again and it seems even worse. :-)

That she couldn't get a refund means the bank didn't treat it as an unauthorized charge. On the other hand, it's BBC, and she lives in Wales. I understand the EU and the UK are much more about personal financial responsibility for things like this than the USA is.  (Like, people panicked at accidentally exposing their credit card number because they'll be responsible for the charges.)

That said, reading the article, everyone's saying ""it's really your fault, because all that stuff is already there and we told you about it."" It doesn't sound like ""I didn't know."" She got all kinds of notifications and probably did nothing about it for a few days, being so busy due to unemployment and all.

> Surprisingly uncommon actually 

Apparently not in this case, based on that same reread of the article. :-) And I get a message for every online purchase. Granted, I don't buy thing in app very much.

""We'd just seen hundreds of transactions, these payment confirmations, so then the panic set in - oh my gosh, whose card is this on?,"" 

> Blizzard are terrible for that shit

It used to be everyone, including Steam. I'm not sure how or why it changed. Whether it was just reputation or whether some regulations got changed.

> you can send it back for any reason for free within a certain window for a full refund

I'm pretty sure if the kid eats the candy, you can't send it back. :-) But sure, other regulations are different in different places. I don't think that applies in the USA, for example.

> if you live with a kid it's pretty challenging to keep secrecy

Because kids are involved (compared to the older player base of games like RuneScape) these websites are probably going to be sued or will have legal action taken against them, unless if they are other countries where it's hard to get jurisdiction.

Not doing that is teaching him a bad lesson.  And yes, I have kids.  I have a 6 year old, a 4 year old, a 2 year old, and a newborn.  All boys.  My 6 year old is definitely old enough to understand right from wrong and consequences for something like this.   He may very well have not understood that he was in fact using real money, and you also need to make sure he does. It's great that you see this as a humbling experience for yourself in terms of it being so easily accessible, but you really, really should try to get it refunded and then use this to teach your child a good lesson instead of basically letting them get away with it. Sarcastically quipping that the only other option is corporal punishment seems to be missing the point intentionally.",2021-12-20,1639961487.0

Making friends can be difficult but you should know that someone liking the same game as you only means just that, they may have a personality that clashes with yours and you may not end up getting on with one another.

You should base whether you want to be friends with someone by a more overall vibe rather than based on a shared hobby. 

Also straight up claiming 'i want to be your friend' is kind of creepy. When you find someone suitable to be a friend, just talk and take the time to talk again some time, it's that easy.

r/parenting,"Roblox deserves more hate Fortnite gets
You can't change my mind. Roblox was only famous because it was hated and stayed that way because it was hated. IT has may more microtransactions, a way more toxic community, and overloaded bugs

&#x200B;

\- Microtransactions

In Roblox, you have to pay for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, I'm pretty sure you can spend more money playing Roblox for a couple days than you ever can playing Minecraft you're entire life!  You have to pay for tools, to play games, to move around, enter places, and even just plain old live! And yes, I am very much aware that is real life, but there is a reason people play video games! Fortnite have micotransactions, on SKINS! It's not pay-to-win if you have skins, they literally admit that ""the skins give people no advantage in games"". And plus, they give you money as you play the game, it's a steal! 

\- Community

Roblox players bully everyone else, I was bullied into playing Roblox by my friends because they said it was ""better than Minecraft"", they had no evidence at all, all they did was try to cover up everything else and bicker me that I hated it. Roblox players since the games have been popular have been bullying Minecraft players and blindly hating everyone who plays it. Fortnite players tend to be toxic to one-another, but outside they tend to leave you to you're own devices. Or just suggest playing it, I had a friend who found out I didn't have Fortnite and suggested I play it, kindly. Unlike Roblox, the Fortnite community is the only place the hate comes from.

\- Bugs

I don't need to explain this, Roblox bugs are laggy and crash all the time, they never fixed it and just kept the game the way it was. I took me over 3 minutes to log into the game, it shouldn't take that long! Fortnite is barely half of one.

Seems like every map/gamemode? had really invasive microtransactions which was shocking considering roblox demographic is young impressionable children. I heard it is not uncommon for community developers to make 5 figure incomes making modes for the community and monetizing them.  I legit considered making my own stuff as I have experience in LUA and 3D Modeling and general quality of stuff in game is C Tier quality which stunned me for how much money gamemode makers were making with such low effort content. I ultimately felt investing in the community was deadend for what my goals are and I could invest time elsewhere.

I am surprised Roblox hasn't broken yet. There are so many hackers, they are starting to destroy games (Like Prison Life, Breaking Point and Mortem Metallum), driving some of them to THEIR DEATH, and they win because they aren't taken down despite hundreds of reports from hundreds of players. But then if you post a meme of Ugandan Knuckles, then you must go to the perma-ip ban section for life. And because of this, eventually, when these games die, the hackers will go for more Roblox games, and it will be too late if the mods take action. In other words, while Roblox becomes more profitable, it will not be worth it to do bare minimum work when Roblox shuts down from over hacked games leading to an exodus of users (they were already hurt from the October incident)",2022-02-15,1644936277.0

I’m sure some people will respond with this game is great or p5 is a great anime game. So I’ll just say I’m not saying every anime game is worse than what roblox fans make.


But holy crap these kids go off. I grew up on old school roblox it was my first journey into multiplayer games when I was like 10. It was all goofy stuff back then, though I do remember this game were you could turn into every Pokémon at the time and it was sick.

Now they have full fledged games. I personally don’t mess around on roblox much now a days. I use to play one of the naruto games in my spare time at work. The general consensus I’ve seen from one piece fans is that “Blox Fruits” is the best way to experience the one piece power system in game.

Now these games do have one serious flaw and that’s they are designed like gacha games. I don’t know if they all are but every one I tried, even some niche anime like Tokyo ghoul the games were riddled with gambling to get the ability you want.

So I guess the question is if a bunch of people on roblox can make these great examples of what an anime game should look like. Why is it so hard for actual game developers to do it.

Every anime title now a days is a empty open world adventure game, a uninspired unbalanced fighter, or a poorly optimized rpg(yes I’m still mad about how bad the fairytail game runs)",2023-04-20,1681987680.0

Not NSFW per se, but with better graphics and no chat filter so it appeals to older, more mature audiences.

r/parenting,"Roblox bullies against other games
(I put this post on r/truegaming but the mods there deleted it and some people are saying it was cause it was about Roblox)

I am working on a small documentary series focusing on all the cruel and scummy things Roblox has done, the first one being Roblox's discrimination against other gamers.

I often refer to Roblox as the Bully of all Games, due to most Roblox players being absolute jerks towards people who play other games and Roblox's actions against other games.

Roblox gained popularity in the early 2000s and was considered an icon at the start of the 2010s, however, that start of the new decade brought along a small game that would unbeknownst to Roblox become a more influential and greater game. When Minecraft came into being in 2011 after its alpha stage in 2009, its popularity skyrocketed. It flocked to so many players due to its simplicity and hidden beauty, in the Roblox forums, there was one player even suggesting some people check it out. But soon, Roblox started banning players who said MC or Minecraft in their forums, they stated it's just for copyright reasons, but it doesn't take a genius to know otherwise. Referencing the name of something in an online platform doesn't fall under any copyright rule or law, henceforth this claim should be considered invalid. It's also happened today, I had a friend who mentioned he got banned on his alt account for saying Minecraft, and I met another person on Roblox who had a similar interaction. While it may seem less common, Roblox is still going after MC players.

They've also gone after other games like Fortnite where they filed a false lawsuit against Epic Games over a logo. The Epic Games logo looks like the square in the Roblox logo, but it's right-side-up, this is a clear violation of the copyright rules which contain fair usage. Epic isn't making money off the logo and it's a square that's transformed from its original product. However, Roblox still tried to sue Fortnite, but this eventually failed and fell through.

Another Redditor beautifully explains that one time Roblox took full credit for another game's success, a Roblox dev quit Roblox due to the moderation refusing the help with trolls copying his game and selling it for higher prices and studied unity to make another game when this game blew up Roblox took full credit for something they had nothing to do with.

There have also been community-oriented cases where far too many games are bad versions of the other games and in most cases, these copies are behind a paywall. While many could say this is for those who don't have the money to buy the real games, the copies are behind a paywall still and their usually bad versions.

Outside the platform, Roblox players would bully other gamers, I've seen many videos of Roblox kids trying to cancel random Minecraft YouTubers for no reason and I myself have faced lots of bullying and harassment for liking other games over Roblox.

The worst part is people would support this and Roblox's actions against other games. This is why I don't like Roblox, they discriminate against other games and allow their users to do the same.",2022-02-16,1645045893.0

My son plays Roblox. One of the games within it is his favorite: ""Slap Battles"". He will play it and then will become exceptionally frustrated and will start crying if he's not being successful. I've played with him and am terrible. I played for half an hour this morning and got 4 slaps in. I was becoming frustrated.

I explained this to him. I suggested that when he gets frustrated he should take a break, or play a different game. He continued playing; until a few minutes ago when he had a bit of a breakdown.

How do I teach him to be a good sport about these things without simply taking his device away? PvP can be very frustrating, but at some point you gotta take a break.

r/robloxparents,"Dad of 2 here. I have a 6 year old who loves video games and gets extremely frustrated very easy. Part of it is that he's just got a cocktail of genetic issues he's inherited from me, so it's not easy for anyone. But I've found two things that seem to work.

First is more generally a behavioral, grounding thing. We regularly have him do breathing exercises to help him slow down and calm down. It took a while getting to where he can do it regularly, and we've still got a ways to go. But when he starts getting worked up and frustrated, we have him pause whatever he is doing, whether it's a video game, playing with toys, friends, chores, whatever; and take three deep, slow breaths. We've even quantified it, which actually helps him understand a lot. When he's super crazy and out of control, that's a 10. Normal breathing is around a 3 or 4. But this slow, grounding breathing is a 1. He knows that he's not supposed to breathe at a 1 all the time, but we tell him to breathe at a 1 to calm down and get control. Then start breathing normal at a 3. But when he's playing and excited and having fun, he can go crazy around 7 or 8. But even when playing, if we tell him he's at a 10, he knows that's always too much and he needs to calm down.

Like I said, it took some doing to get to where he can do this, but he likes numbers, and likes to quantify most things numerically, so for him, this helps a lot.

Second - example. I'll play games with him, and as we do, I let him win sometimes. And I make a bit of a show when he beats me like, ""Oh man! I lost! You beat me! Good job!"" Acting disappointed, but not sad or frustrated and still making sure he sees I'm happy, again, not upset. But then I'll beat him in the game and of course, he gets upset, so I use it as a deliberate teaching moment, like, ""Hey, you did really good! It's okay to be disappointed because we all want to win. Disappointed is okay, but getting mad isn't. Instead, tell the other person things like ""Good Job! You beat me! I'll get you next time!"" And then you practice and get better and better."" After trying to tell him, then I show him by letting him beat me again, and I make another show of disappointment with that exaggerated ""Oh man! You got me again!"" But making sure to laugh and show him I'm still having fun. Then actually pointing out, ""See? I lost, but I didn't get upset. I'm telling you good job and giving you a high five, and we're still having fun."" Trying to teach and point out the example.

Sometimes I do something similar with single player games. Been playing some Rogue Legacy 2 lately, when I get a chance and I took time to point out to him that I get disappointed sometimes with dying (which happens a lot in the game, being a rogue like and all), so I try to be an example, letting him know it's okay to be disappointed, but not to get mad. Again, occasionally making a show of it for his sake; ""Oh man, I died again. But that's okay. I'll just try again and get better and better.""

That sort of thing. Making sure to teach, actually give an alternative behavior instead of a flat ""No, don't do this thing."" Nobody, especially kids, do well just being told ""Don't do X"", but if they're given an alternative, it generally always works better. Instead of a ""don't"" it's a ""try this instead"". For both the whole breathing and sportsmanship thing. Being told ""Calm down! Stop that behaviour!"" Doesn't usually work, but ""Do this behavior instead"" works more often.

But full disclosure, I'm not perfect at any of this, and kids aren't obedient. It never works perfect. And sometimes it just ends up with everyone upset and in thier rooms for some needed quiet time. That's just parenting.

Edit: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I thought it would. I just hope it helps a few people out there. Every kid is different and this might not work with all kids, but hopefully it's given a few parents some ideas.

Teach techniques, such as breathing, squeezing stress balls, rubber band on the wrist, etc. There isn’t a one size fit all trick, it’s going to depend on your kid.

Other than that, it’s about emulation. Kids emulate what they see and hear, figure out where your kid learned this behavior and address that. My kid blames me, and rightfully so, when he was younger, I did have bad anger control. It’s something I’ve fixed for myself and I share that with him and let him see that.

Finally, redirect to another activity can help as well. I tell me kid that the point of games is to have fun, if you’re not having fun, play something else or do something else. Roblox has plenty of games that don’t require PVP.",2023-10-07,1696698883.0

I taught them that it’s part of the game. We can’t always be immediately good or guarantee a victory. That losing isn’t always the end. To learn how they lost, why they lost, what they can do to do better. I taught them that losing was part of the experience. There’s never a guarantee you’ll win. I had to explain to them that even Dad loses his matches, someone they look up to. Once I told them how I deal with losing, they started to apply that in their gaming.

r/robloxparents,"As someone that avoids PvP of any kind because my short fuse with cussing at the game, can't always help it. I stay away from stuff that I have a short fuse for, competitive gaming is one of those things. I do great generally, but the one time I die in a stupid way (whether just a busted powerful one-shot, or my own stupid decision or mistakes) I end up cursing at the game. It's not worth upsetting family with the shouting. 

I don't chat with random people in games except to greet or to toss out a ""gg"" (good game), regardless of how I felt, after the match. Frustration isn't a bad thing, it's just whether he stifles acting out because of it. Frustration is a natural byproduct of a competitive spirit, and should be a motivator not a detriment. 

I played games with my nephew constantly as he grew up, and he saw me get irate at games all the time. Getting irked is fine, but getting so upset that you're not thinking about how to do better is counterproductive. Just try to drill into his mind that playing against other people tends to have someone lose, but there's ALWAYS more people to play against and always more games to play.

It seems like PvP related stuff is all the rage, and as someone that grew up with Unreal Tournament and Quake and such I totally get it. But the added energy drain of dealing with other players online is not my cup of tea anymore.

Making someone else frustrated in some way will make them tilted and they’ll mess up more. It’s why stupid tricks work sometimes and why gimmicks work too. (Not sure for roblox, just in general)

So one strategy to win a game is to make the opponent tilt. Talk to him about things that aggravate him that others do. Then discuss how it makes him play worse, then how he can incorporate those things to frustrate the opponent.

Getting tilted isn’t a problem. It’s the attitude you have toward it.

If an opponent pisses you off during a game, that’s ok. After the game laugh about it and say “that thing you did had me so mad, good job. Great game.”

So, on the one hand I recognize the behavior, and that it isn't good. None of the shit matters in 10 minutes. But controlling the melt down is very difficult.


Potential solutions:

1) have him play with friends. I wouldn't be caught dead melting down in front of friends (and now that I'm older, I won't melt down in front of anyone at all). It's embarassing. Plus playing with friends opens up certain ball-busting commentary which is fun if it goes both ways, and distracts from the melt down.

2) allow one outburst that serves as a warning. A second outburst triggers an immediate 30 minute cool down for that game only. You have to be strong and stick to the rule, no bargaining. Condition the behavior away.

3) medication. Not saying you should give your kid drugs...but somehow, I have the power to understand why I am losing if I have smoked weed and can calmly make adjustments to my playing. I am certain there are better prescriptions that do a better job. Your results may vary.

4) sometimes games or other players really do cheat! Must accept the things that are out of your control.",2023-10-08,1696776266.0

Numbers are a great tool to set reference points and expectations in general. We do it with classroom noise. A 0 is no noise or talking (generally for tests are etc), a 1 is whispering or low level talking to neighbors, a 2 is for regular classroom discussion, a 3 is recess levels (yelling excitement). 

Also check out Figure 8 breathing, super helpful for calming down. Quick and easy to do wherever.

It's only a game and you're bound to lose to any of the millons of people you're playing.

Even professionals in sports, video games, or anything else you can think of lose from time to time and that's okay. It's the only way to get better. Everyone losses. 

Learn from the losses and you'll win more often.

Added: no but honestly, gaming can help kids learn about discipline if you'd ask me. Lets say you're at school and got homework. If you don't finish homework and not learn, you fail the test. Fail enough times and you won't pass or even fluke out.

In sports, if you workout you can train like a beast and achieve your goal or you can wimp out and remain with dreams of goals. Or your team doesnt win.

At work without discipline you'll never get opportunities that may help you in the future,  be it certain skillsets or positions. 

In gaming when you quit, you can pick right up where you left off. It you quit, nobody gets hurt. But if your kid fails, tries another strategy, or keeps leveling until they can beat a boss, level or whatever, that shows in a safe way that to get somewhere, you need to keep trying and keep going.

For roblox parental controls you can disable communication completely and make it so only games with a E for everyone rating can be played, you can also disable in app purchases but there shouldn’t be a credit card linked to their IPad or whatever they use in the first place.

However If you wanna try and prevent your kids from accessing it you can, if they’re around 4-7 years old you probably could do so successfully, but once it gets to a point where they’re around 9-13 it’d just be better to put parental controls cause there’s no way you’re preventing them from playing, you’d just THINK that you are.",2023-10-07,1696703091.0

r/parenting,"Roblox is underrated
I think everyone here knows what Roblox is. Roblox is a game where you can script and build games for an online community with millions of players. It began development back in 2005 and was actually pretty good from 2006-2008. After 2009 however, the game got increasingly more popular. The community just turned to utter bullshit. Minecraft youtubers started playing Roblox and kids who played the game started uploading cancerous videos to youtube.
Roblox became greedy and took control of this popularity and used it to get more money. On the website, every time you logged in you would get 10 tix (Tickets) and you use these tickets to buy things on the catalog or you could trade them in for robux, the in-game currency. They took away this feature, leaving the players to buy robux using real money or to buy their ridiculous membership to earn robux every day, similar to the way you earned tix.
Now Roblox was making more money than they ever had before. But then came the coders and game developers. After Roblox added a feature to earn money off of your games, game developers came to Roblox to use it's growing popularity with kids to earn lots of money. And lets face it, all kids are cringy and stupid. This being said, they like cringy and stupid things. So said game developers made stupid, cringy games and they got very, very popular.
Roblox’s community has grown since 2015 though. So this means that more and more kids have come to Roblox and started playing their toxic games. Roblox admins being their autistic selves, remove features such as the forum, comments on games and just recently game genres. 
Roblox’s reporting system is also ass. If you report a hacker or an oder ( Online Dater) literally nothing happens. You can do LITERALLY whatever the fuck you want on any game and you will not be prosecuted by any means by the Roblox admins.
So now I bet your wondering, why are you still defending Roblox by saying it’s underrated if it’s community is such a bag of hamster shit? Because the community and the staff is the problem. The game itself is phenomenal. You can download Roblox’s free software Roblox Studio and use it to build games and upload them to the Roblox site where you can play with your friends. You can add extensions to your games so that it allows you to build within the game online, meaning you and your friends can build things together. WAIT ANON, THATS JUST FUCKING MINECRAFT. No, my friend that’s where you are wrong. I’m not gonna get into Minecraft and its community right now but I can tell you that Roblox is better than Minecraft. Not by the community of course, but the gameplay. In Minecraft you are limited to blocks that are all the same size. But in Roblox you can have blocks, spheres, wedges, cylinders and every other shape you can think of. Along with this you can also resize the blocks to whatever size you desire. You can copy and paste blocks and structures as well so that comes in handy. You can also import 3d models and animate things, create cutscenes, morph your character in-game, code your own add ons and weapons and so much more. This is truly an amazing tool. Roblox at it’s core is a great game being fogged by the immature, toxic community that its created.",2018-03-26,1522028121.0

My younger family members love Roblox, and I kind of saw it as big as Minecraft in my head (grew up on Minecraft).

I was comparing top gaming companies after Microsoft's new AB acquisition, one of the metrics (I think market captilization) had Roblox on the top of all gaming companies, including Nintendo. 

I realize that context is needed to understand statistics, and I don't quite understand all the cogs and gears to this statistic.  I know Roblox is a big game, but was very surprised that any metric had it on par with other huge companies like Sony, Nintendo, Epic, and Microsoft. So I feel like there is something I missed in the past 7 years or so where Roblox must have blown up. When did Roblox get so huge? And, if relevant, why?

Thanks :)

‘Simon posted a threat in October 2021 that apparently targeted that year's Roblox Developers Conference.

If you see this individual at RDC please call 911 immediately."" The post included a hyperlink to a video titled ""SOMEONE BLOW UP ROBLOX NOW,"" which had been deleted from YouTube in 2015 but was temporarily re-uploaded, and that video (now once again offline) included direct threats to the Roblox Corporation.

The September 2021 lawsuit (PDF) alleges that this post—along with a follow-up post saying, ""Don't come to RDC tomorrow""—contributed to the company putting the event into ""a temporary lockdown while local police and private security conducted a search to secure the facility.""

One rule in my house for my son right now is that he can't play any games online or with random people. He's totally fine with it. YOU make the rules, stand by them, it'll be alright! (I'm sure this will change as he gets to be in high school). 

My husband and I play games, grew up on them and haven't stopped, so we know the ins-and-outs of the gaming world. Start with fun games, light-hearted games that don't promote violence or use guns. Kirby, Pokemon (like Let's Go Pikachu), Mario/Yoshi games are a good start.",2023-02-27,1677467419.0

r/robloxparents,"I'd almost recommend emulating the older pokemon games since they're not too complex compared to the newer ones (2d screen by screen vs full 3d world). A lot of stuff that's on older systems is generally going to be more simplistic (stuff like gba, ps2, etc) if you can find ways to access it.

Otherwise, my 7 and 5 year old niece and nephews got a switch for Christmas, and the games they have the easiest time with so far are super smash bros ultimate and like mario kart. I still beat them the vast majority of the time (they ask me to go hard lol), but they're picking it up decently. I've heard they're alright at switch sports and just dance but haven't played those with them while babysitting. They struggle a fair bit with mario party superstars (the mini games in particular, trying to explain each one is a nightmare), which surprised me.

Remakes of classic games might be good options too. Like the Spyro trilogy remake or the Crash Bandicoot one too. Lego games I've heard are fairly simple as well.",2023-02-27,1677484079.0

My guess

1.Its a kid game, so many kids play ROBLOX that it's literally just viewed as a kids game.

2.Maybe the front page , the front page for a new player can make ROBLOX look bad since there's a lot of awful games on the front page besides arsenal and phantom forces.

3.The controls, maybe some people just don't like the controls and graphics of the game and it just made Roblox look bad for them.

4.The toxic community, there are a lot of toxic kids on ROBLOX. So playing a game and seeing kids say ""ez"" , ""nub"" just makes the person quit when starting off and trash the game.

5. Pay to win , compared to Minecraft where you can get free skins, nobody wants to pay for Robux when starting off and just find it pointless

There's nothing inherently bad about roblox as a game engine and platform. As a company their practices are fucked but that's not what this rant is about. Its about this changes to roblox itself that made it unfun to use.  


1. Removal of Tix. The removal of tix made it so roblox were unobtainable without spending money.  The tix to roblox exchange and their constantly shifting values got me into stock trading as a child and was a major reason I was even allowed to use roblox. 
2. Monetization: robox games used to have one or two purchasable VIP tee-shirt that were one-time purchases with no ability to sell things without tying them to a shirt. 
3. Save features; Old roblox games were built around being a one-off experience that ended when you closed the game. Now, every game has persistent saves, which is a necessity when you're selling hundreds of things to buy in game like single-use powerups and credit packs. 
4. The gutting of admin commands: when roblox gutted admin commands they were taking a genuinely fun part of roblox away and making several games completly unplayable. 
5. removal of guests; they were fun. They were like NPCs. 
6. A soft complaint but why did roblox turn collision on the robloxian off by default? Making human towers in pregame lobbies was a bit of fun that they didn't have to take form us. 
7. Come to think of it, physics-based games like used to dominate roblox are more or less extinct. Everything's scripted now.  ",2023-08-01,1690911357.0

r/robloxparents,"I feel like many here havent played the beta. The game is a bit different than MW2. 

The gunsmith doesnt require you to play with guns you dont like to unlock attachments. The graphics are technically a bit worse than MW and MW2, but the game has a more vibrant array of color and visual clarity. TTK is noticeably longer. There is less guessing on what will reduce recoil because there is very little recoil from the jump and you dont have 3 to 5 stats that govern recoil. All of the player favorite perks are back and work automatically, but now theyre attached to combat equipment which gives your operator a certain degree of aesthetic change. There are new and old field kits from past games. Operator movement is noticeably a bit faster. It definitely feels more like an arcade fps in terms of gameplay than the other MW remakes.

Im not saying its a totally different game. Youve played it before. It is different than the other MW remakes though. MW2 is terrible. It isnt as awful as MW2. The only current CoD game worse than MW2 was Vanguard.

That being said, im burned out on CoD. It is literally a yearly sports game at this point, and they just cycle old features in and out to keep the playerbase buying the game. Somehow they only hit the exact formula that works for their fanbase once every decade.",2023-10-09,1696825473.0

r/robloxparents,"That's actually not true at all. People buying a game yearly or games that are similar to previous ones dont take away from new games and IPs coming out or have anything to do with their quality. Many game devs have multiple teams that make all kinds of games and work on more than one at a time and the quality of the games can be terrible or fantastic regardless of how fast they pump them out.

We can look at a few examples. The newest Pokemon game was the second one on the Switch and it ran like absolute shit. People still bought it like crazy knowing how poorly it ran. There hadnt been a new Pokemon game prior to it in 3 years yet a lot of the games mechanics didnt change whatsoever and could have been made and released in a much shorter amount of time. The previous one ran MUCH better with far fewer issues. Instead of going forwards they went complete backwards and it was the same dev team.

The last few big Square Enix Final Fantasy titles have been amazing. Final Fantasy 7 Remake was incredible and released in early 2020, then we had Final Fantasy 16 release in June, and well have Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth release at the end of February. Remake and 16 are fantastic games and made by 2 different teams. Rebirth is coming out only 4 years after the previous games release and only 8 months after the a main line FF game before it.

Just because games release quickly, doesnt mean the quality of them are bad. Just because you dont like how a game plays, doesnt mean its bad. I have zero interest in Baldurs Gate 3, Starfield, or Tears of the Kingdom because I didnt like Breath of the Wild. Does that make them bad games? No. It simply means they are not for me.

The only person that looks like a clown here are those like you who hate other people having fun and enjoying games that they dont. The games industry isnt hurt by this in any way. Grow up, stop caring what other people play, and play what you like.",2023-10-09,1696825487.0

Modern Warfare 2 you should definitely wait for a price drop, it's good but it's not worth $45 just for the campaign.

Mw2, 2022, made $800 million in 3 days, and it took ten days for it to surpass $ 1 billion. Before that, the call of duty record holders were mw3 2011 and black ops 2. Why wouldn't they make another  mw3. It's probably going to do better than mw2 2022 mainly because of makarov and the nostalgia from mw2 2009. In my opinion, it's mw2.5.

At the end of the day, it’s your cash and no one can tell ya how to spend it, but your willingness to give the billion dollar corporation a yearly stipend for not much difference between games, every year, is kind ruining the industry for the rest of us with bright minds and lofty expectations. 

I understand that you want to comfortably consume your yearly content, and are probably afraid of ditching that in order to understand the bigger picture that people are trying to paint for you. But then don’t get defensive when others call you out for that. You defending your purchasing decisions, and whining about the poor cosmetic skin developers who need to get paid is effectively the same as defending their crappy business practices that step on the toes of creativity, innovation, and naturally good and fun game design.

r/robloxparents,"Diet soda is one form of self control, as I said. Processed added sugar is a real problem in the United States, it's literally in everything unless you specifically buy something that uses a different sweetener. Most people live with being diabetic for years without even realizing it. The only early symptoms most people get are frequent thirst/urination... Which they'll often supplement with a sugary drink, and slightly worse vision which can just be attributed to ""well I guess I'm getting older"" and fix it with vision correction.

The brain needs sugar, and a lot of it, to do its thing. We're all hard wired to crave it for this reasoning. But evolution doesn't progress as fast as our society has, which is why survival traits our bodies employ are counterintuitive to a comfy, sedentary lifestyle. It's why our bodies still hoard fat, and still try to hoard sugar.

Every time you consume it, the neuropathways in the brain are reinforced to make you want more of it. Eating sugar releases dopamine in a similar way to taking a hit of cocaine causes it to be released. The big difference here is that doing cocaine the first time and subsequent times is a choice. Because of the prevalance of sugar in foods, and the way our society rewards children with candy and desserts, people are getting addicted to it from the time they're babies and it's not really their fault because they're too young to know moderatation and our society as a whole is really only starting to scrutinize the amount of sugar we ingest.

So yeah, if someone wants to drink a can of diet Mountain Dew to prevent them from going HAM on a chocolate cake or some shit, let them. You simply can't go cold-turkey on sugar anyway since your body does have a need for it.....so trying to undermine the addiction argument is a pretty shitty thing to do.

I'm 14 years old, and currently trying to find a decent laptop for my brothers and I to share. I currently have a type of DELL laptop which is touch screen. It was 300+ dollars, yet it can't even run Minecraft. Despite deleting most (almost all) applications that weren't necessary. 
I plan on buying a used gaming laptop, that's at least able to run said games. (Minecraft, Dead By Daylight, The Sims4, and Roblox.) Dead by daylight isn't exactly needed, but preferred.

r/robloxparents,"Incredibly depressing but informative video. Really makes me wonder.. I have young cousins that have been playing it for years and I'm curious how their interactions might have been. Granted I was young and playing games with strangers when I was their age, but Roblox seems like a safe haven for predator types. At worst you get an account ban, and you simply make a new one. 

No official forum, therefore they blatantly are admitting they have no oversight/control over the communications that will occur between users, and they surely don't want that responsibility.

Now I've also kept an eye on it's stock price since its public debut. Starting couple months ago, it jumped to higher levels and seems fairly steady here. I have felt like it is going to be a strong existence because I can tell how much kids like it, but it certainly NEEDS some regulation. 

I mean lots of these games now a days do, Valorant at least won't let people resell their purchases, but they still sell bundles for $80 USD constantly, and people eat that up. Minimum prices are like $15 and theres no way you will stop with just buying one cosmetic skin, when there are many weapons in your arsenal.

I played roblox 3-4 years ago and I have to say that it was a pretty descent game. It was fun and was cool but after some time I stopped playing it for some important reason I can't remember but recently I downloaded roblox again to see what has changed and for some nostalgia you know...So I downloaded the game but something was different. A lot has changed which was good but the game had became boring now. Now it looked like a shitty flash game. It has a toxic community with pay to win games. Some games looked like it was meant so that you can just pay them for nothing.mI was very dissapointed with roblox as I thought that it will have a bright future and may be the best game in the world!But now it sucks. The most popular games there are just made to bancrupt you and it is pay to win. It is a capitalist game and spills with more money get previlege. I hate roblox now becuase of how it is. The more popular games like adopt me just straight up sucks if you don't spend more than a $100 in this shitty game. Games like arsenal are just a straight up copy of cs:go. The only games which are worth to play and just copied and that's why it is atleast somewhat good. You might know about a new popular game called spectre.At first when I found this game I thought that it would be pretty fun and original.

r/robloxparents,"1 Word: Multiplayer

It's the sole reaosn I even considered buying this one. After Sword and Shield, I was completely turned off from the franchise. The one and only thing that made me buy this game, was the fact it had actual, real, co-operative multiplayer. Without that feature, I would have held on to my money and laughed at the current situation the game is in. 

For the first 4-5 hours of gameplay, my experience was mostly acceptible in terms of performance. Framerates weren't perfect but not something I'd complain about, no crashes, battles felt fine. I was starting to question what people were even talking about. But now, in the areas that are more open, you really start to feel the game drag. I have to be getting maybe 10-12 FPS in handheld, which is easier for the Switch to process. In docked mode I can only imagine it's a slideshow. 

But this whole situation isn't new to me. These are the same issues that Sword and Shield were faced with, just magnified a bit. The same developer inadequacies that were present in the last generation, are present and glaring in this one as well. Gamefreak aren't pressured to make a polished experience. They're pressured to meet deadlines. And they do. And the sales get higher every time. THAT is why they're still the team making the mainline Pokemon games. THAT is why the quality is suffering. THAT is why I was done with the franchise last generation.

But they added the ability to outright play with your friends, and that's going to get people excited regardless of performance quality.",2022-11-19,1668851067.0

I have heard good things about the gameplay and mechanics of Arceus and maybe I’ll get that one day but it is not a priority, otherwise I am out when it comes to Pokémon. I wanted to be excited about the new games but they just keep rapidly spitting out garbage and people keep buying it so this will never change.

The Switch hardware is not the issue when it comes to performance of this game. The fact that games which were developed on engines that were made for much more powerful hardware on a custom engine that was never intended to run on Switch can still run, look, and perform better than this mess is nonsense (I am looking at you Witcher 3 and Nier Automata.)

r/robloxparents,"Its too bad because it genuinely is a fun game and it does finally make Pokémon feel new again(Open world, branching storylines, less linearity). Which is something I have not felt in a main line game since Black and White(Sun and Moon was a change but in the wrong direction). I know its easy like Sword and Sheild but I don’t hate that as an old fuck who works now and doesn’t have to sit in grass for hours grinding when I have only 2-3 hours to play. Plus if you were a sweat Pokemon has a million ways to challenge yourself with things like Nuzlockes.

However, for people who care about graphics they did absolutely drop the ball. I am an old fuck that started playing with Pokémon Blue on the Game Boy and my favorite Pokémon games are the older ones with shit graphics. For Pokémon I ONLY care about the gameplay loop and world building. Graphics mean 0 to me for Pokémon so I have been having a blast. For people who care about graphics I can imagine this was a huge let down though. With modern audiences and young kids caring about graphics so much it is baffling Gamefreak and Pokémon Company don’t invest more in modernizing visuals.


Edit: I am also not having the technical issues others are seeing. The games fps drops below 30 occasionally but that doesn’t really matter in a single player turn based game. If I was having the technical issues others were having it would not be a good experience.

r/robloxparents,"I admit it. The tech does not impress. No Pokémon game has ever been cutting edge, they don’t have to be to be good. And , while I am enjoying the hell out of Violet so far, especially now that I’m past the tutorial, the tech issues are.. alarming. The frame drops are some of the most notable I’ve seen on the switch. This kinda game plays fine despite them, but they can really catch you off guard. And some of the more simple geometry of the world is, yes, barely above PS2 quality. Wii level, at most. The last real issue, imo, is the loading stutter after you win a battle. Sword/ Shield, BD/ BP, LGP/LGE, or Arceus didn’t suffer from it at all.
There are a lot of positives, though. The world is vast. The towns and indoor environments are nice looking. The character models and ‘Mons are very sharp and well animated. (In battle at least. And Yungoos’ low poly model doesn’t count because nobody gives a shit about yungoos.) The structure is slick. The UI is great. The characters are interesting.

r/robloxparents,"""You bought it so you don't have a right to complain"" is such a shitty take. First off, nothing is above criticism no matter how good you think it is. Elden Ring and GoW Ragnarok are both frontrunners for GotY, and they both have flaws. Am I not allowed to criticize them because I bought them? Of course I am, that'd be stupid. But because they're both widely recognized as incredible games I don't have to *justify* buying them, so pointing out what I think are one or two weak areas in those games doesn't get the same outright toxic reaction as it does with Pokemon. To be clear, my point here is that spending money on something doesn't mean you think it's perfect, and never has.

For another thing, if you haven't bought a Pokemon game since Gen 3 why should GameFreak care about your opinion, no matter how loudly you complain? You don't represent a potential lost sale because you were never gonna buy this game. But what about the people who bought Gen 8 and complained? Those people got told the exact same thing - ""You bought it so you can't complain"" - but if those same people aren't buying Gen 9 now, they represent *actual* lost revenue. The people who got told that shit actually had the potential to take their dollars somewhere else, and I'm sure many did.

To put it bluntly why waste your energy telling people that now? ""You bought it so stop complaining."" The person's who's complaining is the person most likely to not buy another Pokemon game. It's the people who *aren't* complaining who are gonna buy every new pokemon game when it comes out, even if they get worse than they are now, and probably won't care.

r/robloxparents,"Yeah the graphics suck, but you can’t deny that they are heading in the right direction.

So much innovation is packed into this game, in fact I think it’s probably the most that’s ever been picked into a mainline Pokémon game. 

Like look how much it’s changed since sword and shield. 

Although I’m coping that somehow they will patch this game further, the way I’m seeing this game is that it’s an excellent Pokémon game held back by its technical performance and hardware issues.

But in terms of everything else it’s amazing.

The Pokémon designs are fun and interesting, the open world is huge and full of Pokémon. 

And the rival is a girl? I think that’s a first! And she’s likeable as well, not as annoying as hop.

Actually the cast of characters in this game are so well done. 

And the legendaries? Yeah at first it was weird, but then it started giving me toothless vibes from how to train your dragon and it became kinda cool and cute. 

I’ve yet to delve into competitive battles (since that’s where my true interests lye) but I’m interested to see how it will work since practically every Pokémon can crystallise into a different type. (I hope legendaries can’t crystallise oh god kyogre is going to be problem again) 

But there is so much fun and interesting stuff in this game and honestly it is a huge improvement over sword and shield.

I think instead of 3 years in between mainline entries they should increase that to 5 years, and whatever engine they are using now needs an upgrade pronto. 

Because there are some serious terrain clipping issues, frame rate issues and animation issues happening.

I haven’t experienced any crashing so far and I’m on a Pokémon sword and shield lite console.

But technical issues aside the gameplay is really fun, the world is amazing, and the Pokémon and character designs are fun and interesting.

And at the core of Pokémon games isn’t that what it’s all about? 

I mean Pokémon games have never been about graphics. That’s something the fans and critics tried to push onto gamefreak.

Pokémon sword and shield was the first mainline Pokémon game of its kind. 

And this is the second. 

I mean people argue that fans have always been saying it’s a step in the right direction, but if you look back at the Pokémon games eventually they did reach the pinnacle of design and graphics in any given era of Pokémon.

I mean people shit on sun and moon and sun and moon ultra but you cannot deny that it’s graphics and designs are crisp as fuck. 

Or that black and white 2 were the peak of the ds era.

Or that heart gold and soul silver were the peak of the game boy style of games.

Eventually gamefreak will get to that point. It’s always the case.",2022-11-19,1668853454.0

It's also way better than old Pokemon games by a mile(aside from challenge runs maybe).  


People ask why people keep buying these games when they are this technologically inferior to say Zelda or some Switch ports(Crisis, Doom, Skyrim etc). It's because they are well designed, there is nothing with similar gameplay loop that is even comparable in quality, they are well supported.  All that in half the development cycle of the competition. Sword and Shield had EXCELLENT DLCs, was supported with events and seasons until literally 2 weeks before release of S/V and the game wasn't dead! There were loads of people playing. And all this without any predatory monetary practices or microtransactions. So yeah, technologically cobbled together games, but the gameplay is peerless(not perfect, just nothing else compares from competition), it's well supported and isn't fleecing it's customers for all it can get away with.

Breath of the Wild has like 90% of its monster encounters being pallet swaps of the same 6 or 7 enemies, and there are maybe around 100 total creatures in the game including NPCs, animals and enemies, many of which only need a few simple animations like a fish that just needs to swim and die.

I have vivid memories of games blowing my mind from the storyline to the details within gameplay, but I feel like that’s more and more gone.

Don’t get me wrong, there are hits, and studios that truly work on their craft, but it feels like more often than not, the money side has won out and will continue to do so. 

Rockstar produces gems of games, but their interest has certainly become honed in on their rockstar shark bucks that print them money left and right. Produce RDR2, but fail to deliver on DLC for GTAV while releasing it 10 times.

So many examples like that, but I feel like the point is that companies have seen that they can lack on improving their product and the consumers will still be there. I know as a community on Reddit we say “oh don’t preorder” or “review and refund” etc, but we are in a bubble when it comes to the majority of consumers.

While impacts have been made like the EA battlefront situation, I feel like sales still occur and it’s because there are so many people who just buy the game, play it, and aren’t aware of the millions of things that dedicated gamers complain about that are wrong.

Those vector processing units could really sing when properly used and were also difficult to use, which is a good chunk of why early titles like Summoner looked bad. Emulators also strongly suggest it was the more capable system with plenty of hardware that can run most Dreamcast games easily failing to run any PS2 titles at acceptable framerates.

No, this game doesn't look great. Not defending it that much. In this specific example, it looks like they forgot to stretch the UVs for the wall texture. Could also be the proper size but just terrible resolution. Also not a whole lot of bump map utilization and I'm not sure why. Doubt it's to save on resources because while it would be saving resources technically, I don't see using bump maps more than they currently do being that much more taxing. And the pop in distance is shockingly short. The texture quality distance being short isn't shocking, as that along with LOD models for long distance viewing is standard practice, but what IS surprising in this case is the lack of any kind of work around, like fog or example. That's something common they could've figured out.

Overall, the aesthetic is great (I personally enjoy the look conceptually) and the game is fun. That's really all that matters to me. Would this game looking maybe as nice as BoTW have been cool? Sure! But that means nearly zero to me.

He would go “who is defending this *shit*” when seeing all the issues and all that, but then he turned around and said he was for a fact 100%ing the game.

r/robloxparents,"Just said this a bit ago. I wish Game Freak would lose the license to do Pokémon games. All the money Pokémon rakes in and they still have generic battles that look like old Final Fantasy turn based battles (move forward a bit and swipe at air but it ""hits"" the enemy still bullshit) and they can't even hire voice actors to do narration and voice lines.

I wish Xapcom would get Pokémon development rights. Specifically the team that does Monster Hunter. Pokémon is also being held back by constantly being made for underpowered Nintendo consoles. A Pokémon MMO would be HUGE as long as it isn't like Temtem. 

When Pokémon Go was released for mobile it was EXPLOSIVE so they can't say having at least one or two multiplatform Pokémon games wouldn't be a major success, especially if limited Pokémon were available for each console plus PC and had the ability to trade with other platforms through a centralized hub, kinda like how Dragon Age linked your progress from earlier games and could be transfered to different platforms and games via Dragon Age Keep. 

Don't know if Nintendo suits are just bullheaded or hate money, but that would be my priority if I was in charge. People are already buying the multipacks of both Scarlet and Violet like they did for most of the past games so I could see one person buying for their Switch, PS5, Xbox, and PC just to have the entire collection.",2022-11-19,1668870405.0

The Switch is portable. It's closer to a modern Gameboy which is where Pokémon has always been ""home."" 

Clearly the game has some performance issues but this is a dumb comparison.

Its not a AAA RPG.  It's not a power-sucking home console.

Anybody played Witcher 3 on the Switch lately?  It's a blurry fucking mess, it dips to like 12 FPS constantly.  You can't have it both ways, you get low-poly with a decent framerate, or a blurry fucking choppy mess.

People keep talking about Bayonetta and other games that *do not have an open world.*

Compare this to Phoenix Rising or even BOTW and they all have a bunch of shitty low-poly textures just to try and maintain a decent framerate.

r/robloxparents,"Mark Darrah, the executive producer on the Dragon Age games and Jade empire among others spoke about this on his YouTube channel. 

Essentially, yeah they are cutting corners, but it could be because Nintendo is giving them very short development time and they HAVE to go get the game shipped by when Nintendo wants it. Why spend precious memory and time and manpower making high-res textures for something that most players won’t notice? 

Mark Darrah said in his Dragon Age II video that this is called a “low fidelity asset for a low fidelity set piece”. He says it doesn’t matter that the wall in this case is low fidelity because it’s a wall, you’re not meant to look at it up close, the only thing that matters is that it gives the illusion of a wall from a distance. 

Not defending the use of it in this case but just pointing out it might be the executive producers decisions to save time or Nintendo themselves that are to blame for pokemons decline, not the developers themselves. Once again speak with your wallet",2022-11-19,1668872446.0

Why does anyone care?

I *do* know how shitty the pokemon games have gotten from a technical standpoint, and I've only been playing since X/Y. But at the end of the day, the gameplay is exactly the same every single time, with little to no difference from game to game. So I don't buy every game, but when I do I'm not thinking ""This is wrong of me, I should boycott this so that the graphics will get better and they'll really put in the effort."" I'm thinking ""been a little while since I've played pokemon, it'd be fun to play again with some new ones.""

I'm also disappointed by this new one based on the frame rate issues, and it might affect how soon I'm willing to purchase a new one, but it's not unplayable. So I really don't get shaming people for buying it, just let them play the games they like.

Most of you people probably don’t remember but way back when ultra sun and ultra moon released they were pushing the 3DS hardware to its max just like these games are pushing the switch hardware to the max.

r/robloxparents,"I can't anymore...

Okay, I know people will agree and disagree, but it's not just the Pokemon players, and everyone else saying it is most likely a hypocrite in some way shape or form.

Have the last few Pokemon games had visual issues and gameplay issues? Yes. Do we have thoughts or have some feelings that the next game is going to be like that? Sure. But should we just now come to expect all games to be like this from now on? No... That's an awful thing to do.

On top of the fact I don't care what the hell you think. But time and time again, and it's not the fan/gaming community's fault, the whole vote with your wallet thing doesn't work. Whenever we talk about stuff like that, it's always a small vocal number of people. The number of parents or just children (Even adults) who don't really care to go online and read about how ""Game company flops again with release of game"" is large. I've talked to several of these people as I work in retail. 

I can't tell you how many times I'll say ""Oh yeah, things have been going down this X game/X company"" and hear ""Oh really? I don't really pay attention to that stuff.""

So to all those people that are just going to come on here and say ""Stop complaining, this is all your fault"" please... Tell me that you didn't buy something that had problems, were very upset about, but still Loved it anyways. Okii thanks for coming to my Ted Talk...",2022-11-19,1668899502.0

Despite how ""money-grubbing"" that game can be, I can see the care done to that game by the devs for the characters and lore.

Sometimes not even within the first 6 months. I take my sweet time and wait until I'm damn sure I want to buy a game. I've boycotted EA and activision/blizzard as well.

Another thing is this: just because you bought a game, found out that it sucks, and left a 0/10 review means absolutely fucking nothing. That publisher/developer already has your cash and that's the only incentive they need to fuck you again.

I swear, gamers are fucking braindead. Since Minecraft launching in beta, more and more games have been launching in less finished states to the point you have people pre ordering shit like cyberpunk and no mans sky which are borderline unplayable. Why would companies care when you gave them your money before even seeing the final product. Everyone is up in arms because ""HoW cOuLd ThEy Do This?"" and then next year buys the same exact unfinished piece of garbage. People complain about how GTA is so monetized and Rockstar never delivered those single player DLCs they mentioned years ago, yet the moment people get wind of GTA 6, its like GTA V was a flawless masterpiece. Fallout 76 still is a broken mess last I heard, but people are clamoring for TES 6. 

At this point, I think we basically deserve getting milked like this because it seems like nobody learns.

r/robloxparents,"Yep. This is a texture pop in issue.

Frankly speaking - the Pokémon and people of the world look quite nice and indoor areas have a lot of Charme and flair. Like an anime come to live.

The issue is that outdoor areas try to look better than Arceaus but the switch isn’t up to it at ally. and yes I am aware the engine is probably not well optimized and BotW and xenoblade look better but if the Switch he a bit more power even this engine probably could have pulled it of much better. 

What is certainly an issue of the devs though are some hideous LODs for trees and docked mode needed and even lower res to be completely fluent. In handheld mode the game is absolutely fine though and that tells you about the priorities for the devs… kids / teenagers with a switch lite or playing in handheld mode with a classical switch.

Tbh though, the graphics and performance are really shitty.  However, the game is really fun and the design changes to the gameplay have been really engaging & support exploration more so far.  Much better than the Route 1’s with unavoidable trainers and grass in every prior game.

r/robloxparents,"You want to know why BOTW can afford to look better? Because a huge amount of their enemies are just pallet swaps of each other and share the exact same animations and attacks. Pokemon games have hundreds of different pokemon that all need unique art assets and a full suite of animations. With each pokemon needing lets say 20 different animations (probably on the low end considering all the overworld interactions they added), and lets guess it takes an hr for a basic animation as a lowpark baseline, that would mean it takes 8000 hrs just to fill out the basic animations. Then you have all the unique models, their textures, their rigs, their effects, their sounds, etc. and you have an insane amount of work that has to go into creating all these unique assets and any attempt to increase the graphical fidelity is going to mean hundreds to thousands of hours of work. Mean while BOTW has main 10 species of monster, 8 of which have only pallet swaps for their subspecies, obviously its going to be easier to make higher quality assets and animations there when you can make a new monster just by updating the textures, adding some lightning effects and reusing everything else. I have 0 interest in playing pokemon but seeing people calling these devs lazy frustrates me when they've produced an actual open world, 3d pokemon game with no combat transition, which is a sheer marvel of just for the amount of man-hours needed to produce something on this scale. The only other game that really even approaches the enemy variety of pokemon is minecraft, and they could only do that by simplifying the models down to cubes, making the simplest animations, and using low poly textures for everything.",2022-11-19,1668885265.0

Tbh, I think this piling on Scarlet and Violet seems like a big circle jerk, and the reason there’s not many as people on Reddit defending it, is because they’re too busy having fun playing the games.

I’m not saying the game is pretty, or is up to the standards of other games on the switch. I would prefer a much longer development cycle, too. But it’s not hot garbage or anything like a lot of people that haven’t played it seem to think. It’s pretty fun.",2022-11-19,1668865975.0

I don't know why anyone expects flawless 3d graphics when that has never been the focus of the pokemon games. They have transitioned to 3d slowly and methodically. 


Pokemon X and Y had a grid you walked on. Pokemon sun and moon removed the grid and made the game more free roam then ever, with the option to walk diagonal smoothly. Legends Arceus and let's go Eevee/Pikachu added new catching mechanics and much more in depth movement controls and rotatable cameras. 



Now we have an open world, huge map, with free roam exploration and people are bitching because it doesn't look like it's running on the newest Crytek engine.

r/robloxparents,"A lot of it is gamefreak wants to stay a small team, and if they expanded just enough to have people work only on things like Arceus and remakes while the other team focuses on main series they'd be in better shape development wise.

It's their own mentality that makes the players suffer and it's all approved by Nintendo when they show the product demos. And it's all because people will buy it. If they weren't a second party developer for a first party ip then they'd probably work a bit harder. But with barely 170 people making multiple pokemon games a year even if there are remakes thrown in, we're not gonna get any quality but the bare minimum for release until the series has any competition. But that's unlikely.

I will shit on how the world looks all day cus it for the most part does look bad, sparse and too plain for a lot of it. There's no dense forests,  only 1 or 2 decent sized caves to go through but it's all just one texture at all times.

Past that, the improved apon Arceus wild battle system is fun, the let's go passive battles is a great way to explore without dealing with the monotony of entering and exiting fights all the time.

The music fucking slaps. If you can find team star battle music on YouTube and you can honestly say it's not good then I think your ears might be broke.

And while part of the story is your typical checklist of doing gyms, there's a good bit more besides that's and you can explore freely near immediately. It does a lot of things right along with the poorly rendered world.  I also hardly had any performance issues. The only time is when I've left the game in sleep for hours and going into large water areas with a bunch of things spawning all at once. Saving and relaunching the game solves that. 

The biggest things they need to patch are pokemon spawning in walls and adding a noise for near by shiny Pokemon like Arceus.",2022-11-19,1668858853.0

I really didn't like the last 3 Pokémon games very much, but I'm liking this one a lot. I love the freedom of it, and I REALLY like not having to interact with so many annoying characters. Love the book Pokédex, too!

Tons of features have been gutted including menu options that have existed since the first games. No joke, you can’t turn battle animations off anymore.

Most buildings in the game can’t be entered anymore. Just plot buildings and gyms. Even shops have had their interiors replaced by menus.

Character customization is vastly limited. You have four outfits, and other than that you can’t change your shirt, jacket, or pants. They try to hide this by separating clothing shops so each one only carries one kind of clothing slot. Such as the hilarious sock store.

You can’t filter in the Pokédex anymore. You can’t even jump by 10 (like in the first game when you hit left or right on the deck to go up or down a full page).

TMs all break again. Now you need to craft you TMs from materials you get from wild Pokémon.

Pokemon has been very good about being careful what they add to the game, because generally it all carries forward.

Mega evolution was sort of the start where they stopped that. Tells me they didn't test mega evolution thoroughly enough that they decided to bin it for Dynamax, which was ultimately far less interesting. 

It makes it hard to want to get invested in any of the new systems because it's like, next game they're gonna go on as if the previous one didn't exist.

Just roll them all into mega evolution and change the mechanics to be better balanced. Having new mega evolution forms was probably the coolest part of the mechanic vs ""The same pokemon, except it's the size of a parade float""",2022-11-19,1668841709.0

I started BoTW on my pc at 4K 60 fps and while I enjoyed the high framerate, I ended up seeing the jank too much.

Improving games with higher definition than the artistic design had in mind has always been a bit of a double edged sword in my opinion. The sharpness can sometime ruin the art choices made and reveal the jank in all it's glory. There's a reason people still value CRT monitors to play old PS1 games for example. Also the black crush on even the least egregious of filters was too much. Not to mention the bugs like being thrown up in the air randomly due to invisible water. UI graphical glitches (quarter heart containers have a weird vertical line going down them) and the way the right analogue controlling the camera would get hyper sensitive when talking to NPCs. Worst of all was the asset compilation stutter when loading up new areas (yes once they're loaded in it's fine but the first time experience of immersion gets hindered for it).

No one wants to buy a ds game when you have the 3ds coming out. 

Yes, if it was your first Pokémon game I'm sure it feels like it was perfect. Mine was Diamond and despite how slow it was and all the other problems, I still love it.

Bw2 more or less fixed it but it was too little too late. Plus they were sequels... To games barely anyone bought. Sequels tend to sell less. They were doomed to fail despite how good they were.

Gen 5 might have been good but it's the reason we have the current state of Pokémon. Gen 6 is when the gimmicks started. (mega evolution was the only good one) Gen 6 is when the quality went down. It's when the nostalgia pandering started. And it sold tons. Why would they do a gen 5 again?",2022-11-19,1668851334.0

r/robloxparents,"Makes sense once you realize the new games are so bad because of how poor Black and White, as well as their sequels performed. Black and White were basically a soft reboot of the franchise, with only brand new Pokemon available, animated sprites, and a completely redone visual style that looked amazing? But why did they fail? Because people couldn't play with their old favorites Pikachu and Charizard. It was too far of a step forward- fans didn't care that the games themselves were excellent, they were mad that they couldn't play with the pokemon they were nostalgic for. Keep in mind that although the Generation 5 games have become beloved now, they were the most hated games in the franchise for over 5 years after their release. Gamefreak saw this, and in their next games put in less effort and more nostalgia pandering with gen one pokemon getting the spotlight, and the games sold like wildfires. So why would they care about making technically great games that drive the series forward when fans have shown again and again that a low quality game will sell incredibly well if it has Charizard and Pikachu in it? Sword and Shield are the best selling Pokemon games of all time, and Scarlet and Violet are likely to beat that record. There were images of Gamestops all over packed with adults buying this game. Unless we vote with our wallets nothing will change.

r/robloxparents,"There are multiple reasons for this but none of them is about the games: 

1. Nintendo used to be way weaker. Until the Switch came out Nintendo had huge problems. The Wii U flopped really bad. Basically Nintendo was no competition for Sony and Microsoft. But when they released the Switch with games like BoTW and Animal Crossing, Nintendo started to become more popular again and their games started to get bought more. The switch has been bought way more than Nintendos last mainline consoles so naturally more people can buy their games now. 


2. Pokemon now arrives on Nintendo’s mainline console (Switch) instead of their mobile consoles (DS). While the DS was very successful and sold very well it is still a handheld console to be used occasionally. Most people don’t spend a lot of time sitting with a DS and playing with it. On the other hand consoles like PS, Xbox and Switch get used all the time. So releasing Pokemon on the Switch will naturally make way more people interested to buy it. Especially because the Switch don’t have a lot of AAA games releasing regularly. 


3. The excitement to finally play Pokemon with „good“ 3D graphics and cute Pokemon sprites. I mean every Pokemon fan once dreamed of a good open world Pokemon game where you can explore the world and go on adventures. While the 2D Pokemon games are great and shouldn’t be discontinued (imo) 3D games are just the current standard for games. GF are just bad at it. If a competent company would invest lots of money into a good 3D Pokemon game I am sure it would easily beat most of the old 2D Pokemon games.   Unfortunately right now it is enough to just create some open 3D world with Pokemon to make Fans buy the game. But I think this is just the early excitement. Pokemon ScVi is currently the second real 3D Pokemon mainline game and the first one with a real open world. A lot of fans will just buy it because of this. But in a few iterations when 3D open world Pokemon games are the default people will start to not give a fuck again. Unless of course GF suddenly gets better.",2022-11-19,1668851353.0

2: Glad to see Gigantamax is back in the new games!

3: To everyone complaining about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet

4: No, we shouldn’t give Pokémon a pass for the state of this game at launch

5: I was just approved for a refund of my digital purchase of Pokemon Violet.

6: We need to be voicing our opinions outside of the subreddit.

7: Enough is enough

8: Paths are a Lie

9: Just got approved for an eShop refund for my Pokemon Scarlet preorder. If you're not liking the game, I urge you to do so as well.

10: They removed the option to disable battle animations. Why?

11: SV feels like an unfinished game

12: The throwing mechanic from PLA is sorely missed in Scarlet and Violet

13: In the span of one month, you can now say that fans of Sonic games are in a better position than fans of Pokemon games.

14: We criticize because we care (Game Freak and the state of modern Pokémon games)

But fr pre ordering is just a fucking scam. It let's asshole devs continue to half ass their games.

Some of my favorite pkmn games are Gold/Silver and boy did it EVER make me feel better than playing G/S on emulators or ESPECIALLY better than HGSS on DS, which I also felt like was an amazing Pokémon title. 

TemTem really brings it hard. Looks good, runs smooth (disclaimer, at least on PC, don't own a Switch or traditional console but iirc it's available on everything so cant comment on that), it is very transparent about how/why battles go the way they do (no crits, visible damage multipliers, etc), no PP system so moves are on a stamina/number of turns metric that works very nice, and it is legitimately multi-player. 

That is probably my favorite thing about TemTem. I finished the game and recommended it to my friends. They needed some help, so I bred late game mons I never really got to use but that looked cute/cool/I liked their types and then we could just party up and play through it without impacting game play much (all battles in TemTem are doubles, even if you are a solo player. Difference in multi-player just means each player gets 3 mons instead of 6). Can't recommend it enough. Most fun I've had playing a Pokémon/ monster catching game since I was a child playing GS.

pokemon would be good if it were *more* consistent.  what's wrong with the game is them fucking with the formula.

a new batch of pokemon, new region, new story, and some new mechanics (a la mega / z moves / max raid battles) is plenty of change from generation to generation.  and usually these are the parts of the game that GF mostly gets right, while also consistently sprinkling in tiny QOL features here and there to make parts of the game less painful.

the problem is, instead of only changing those things, we also get the national dex getting sliced to ribbons and the inability to actually ""catch em all,"" we get longtime features like battle tower REMOVED FROM THE GAME, and we get a 2d game company saying ""fuck it"" and making an open world game while still trying to figure out how to make a decent 3d game at all

if all they did was charge me $60 and throw 80 new pokemon in the same game without taking any out I would literally be happier with that than the product that released today.  Ironically it does seem like GF is trying.  I wish they'd stop.

You can imagine my excitement when gamefreak first announced they were going 3d with free roam areas in sword/shield then open world in scarlet. Yet somehow, they've managed to make an open world game have *less* exploration than their earlier 2d games, it's baffling. Sword and Shield were a joke with their empty wild areas and straight line routes and Scarlet and Violet seem to be an even bigger joke with not being able to enter most buildings and the wild being vast and empty.

r/robloxparents,"I'll be honest as a player rn the only issue I'm annoyed at is it feels very poorly optimised. Ive been a fan long enough to go in with realistic expectations of what the company does with its games and frankly I think they did a bang up job with SV;

- they've expanded the core game loop by integrating the PLA style Pokémon titan storyline and Team Star storylines as being equally weighted against gym battling. 
- They've significantly improved the concept of open-world play even compared to PLA, which still kind of forced you to level through zones in a set order, whereas SV is more flexible.
- They've really made the game more multiplayer friendly. The only battles you can co-op are raids, sure, but that seems perfectly consistent within the world itself, and the multiplayer system has been pretty damn seamless as we've used it.

Graphics have never been a strength of Pokémon and the fact people try and pretend otherwise is just fucking stupid on their part. Everyone knows what Game Freak are about when it comes to that. I won't try and excuse poor optimisation and shitty performance for the game they've made, it should be better than it is because what they've built is not especially taxing to the system if built correctly.

Red/Blue on gameboy...I got a binder in storage filled with pages upon pages of first edition shadowless cards from year 1 when the phase started. VHS tapes from the anime tv show that my mom would record for me while I was in school(still got em somewhere in a storage unit lol).

I pick em up to see what's changed in many years. I do love the open world and multiplayer aspect of it. That is something I dreamed of having decades ago!  I rarely use the switch, so I'm not really bothered by graphics, and I am enjoying the game. If I wanted fidelity, I would go sit in my chair with my 3440x1440 ultrawide and play a PC game. :)

I actually have the switch hooked up to an old 720p TV so I can get better performance out of it and I have it loaded on the switch's internal memory with read speeds that are 3x as fast as SD/Cart, which helps in a game that uses heavy culling over loading screens. These two things may be helping greatly with my experience, especially the 720 TV.

I admit I set the switch to 1080p mode just to see, and was like nope that is way too laggy and immediately went to 720 and it was a lot better, and that shouldn't ever be a thing on a console game.",2022-11-19,1668878998.0

Either way, Nintendo needs better hardware regardless.",2022-11-19,1668836847.0
r/robloxparents,"Absolutely. It’s really disappointing. And look, I’ve done some game development. I get that it’s no simple task designing, building, balancing and animating a thousand Pokémon in a single development cycle and there’s likely a trade-off between how mechanically and visually complex they are vs having all of them in the game, but this is the most lucrative media franchise in THE WORLD. They absolutely have the budget/resources if they need it. Wether it’s Nintendo being cheapskates or GameFreak being obstinate about updating their development process, it’s frustrating. 

Honestly, the visuals aren’t what irks me. I can handle an ugly game if it’s innovative and fun, but outside the new and very welcome open-world mechanics, the games have mostly made small, incremental changes between each generation. There’s been a lot of cool additions (I loved Mega Evolutions and regional forms), but I feel like I’ve been waiting decades for this series to really innovate on the Red/Blue formula they’ve been milking for 25 years. The example I always use is: what if Resident still played like RE1 and we never got the revolutionary changes of RE4?

Personally, I’d love a complete overhaul of the battle system. Something more dynamic, even if it’s hybrid-turn-based or even real time. Hell, at least let my Pokémon move around the arena, using the terrain or obstacles to their advantage. Or make distance matter. Like thunderbolt won’t hit at close range but thunder punch will. I’m just pulling these out of my ass, but that already sounds better than 2 dudes standing 10ft apart, taking turns slinging attacks over and over.",2022-11-19,1668839364.0

They understand the switch has less power, but they don't understand what power means. And so they assume that if something is fucked up it's because of this deficit. Alot of people don't have the brain to understand things sometimes. Pokemon SnV is a result of a grueling development cycle for doing a full engine change like the switch and 3d Pokemon has brought us to(2 years for a team who has been historically not great with 3d), the laxing of Nintendo quality assurance due to the pandemic (there was a former NOA PTD giving his input in r/pokemon), and the lack of motivation in management to do a good job as the money will come either way. And this plus probably more brings us the shit storm that we got. At the core without the performance issues the game is really good and interesting. The Pokemon are neat. The co-op is an interesting idea. I love the idea of the gimmick. They stories are different. It's just totally unplayable for motion sensitive people (the people getting headaches and nausea from the game) and in varying states of playable for everyone else based on personal tolerance levels.

Its pacing is a bit all over the place, really.

I was running BotW at a rendered 5K (downsampled to 4K for my monitor) and 120fps. A RTX4090 can jack it all the way up to 8K (pointless though).

Once the move to Vulcan happened performance skyrocketed. Plus the settings to prevent the jank or broken physics (Blight Ganon) at high frame rates came with it.

Personally I'm not a pixel counter, I was just testing to see how high I could play at. I'm perfectly fine with 1440p at 60fps, especially with Nintendo games. The biggest thing I wish the emulators would fix is pop in since the games run great on PC hardware.

r/robloxparents,"I realized this the other day: nearly all of the games I enjoy playing are Indie, more than 10 years old, or both. I think the only ""new"" big studio game I've played in awhile is Jedi: Fallen Order, and after playing for a couple hours-long sessions over a weekend... I got bored with it.

I don't know if it's that I'm settling into being an adult gamer and not in touch with what the ""new generation of gamers"" want (I tried Fortnite, and after playing a bit with friends, I realized battle royales just aren't for me; yes, I know there's more than Fortnite, but that's just one example), or if devs are just making shittier games while also being more predatory... Or if it's a bit of both.

I love what games like Risk of Rain 2 and Valheim have been doing... But it feels like games from AAA studios nowadays are poorly made cashgrabs that want you to buy battlepasses and 4 different kinds of currency AND buy DLC to not get stomped on by others... And I don't want to buy into that, or waste time grinding to even be close to on a level playing field. For awhile now, games have been getting buggier and performance and looks don't get better while system requirements have gotten nuts, because games are so lazily or ineptly made... And why am I paying $70 for this again?

I'd much rather download a fan-made mod for Civ 4 which has bugs, but was made with love, than pay boatloads of money to have all the expansions in Civ 6... And still have tons of bugs, which the devs may or may not fix, eventually. And tbh, there are some gameplay features in Fall From Heaven 2 (dark fantasy mod for Civ 4) and Rhye's and Fall of Civilization (history-focused Civ 4 mod where civs spawn and collapse throughout the game, as they did in history) that are more innovative than ""you can build city tile things and the map looks like real paper. Now buy a bunch of expansions so it will have more depth than Civ 5."" I'm oversimplifying; I understand that a game company has to sell games, and selling DLC with new content is a lot less predatory than Gacha pay-to-win gambling mechanics... but it still seems like a lot of money for stuff we used to expect to be in a base game from launch.

I’m not defending the shoddy work here, they really should spend more on cleaning up the graphics and they absolutely should spend more time optimizing, and not release a broken game. I just think it’s disingenuous to suggest that this game is not in a good state because the devs are being lazy, when this is by far the most ambitious title in the franchise.

- Really beautiful overworld tile art BUT really ugly character sprites and also BUT most of the buildings can't be entered and also BUT the map is extremely linear with no interconnectivity.

- The story was the best pokemon has done BUT it's honestly still a pretty weak story that wouldn't be praiseworthy if compared to non-pokemon games and also BUT Team Plasma takes a complex grey area and completely turns in Black and White (heh) rather than bothering to feature any complexity.

We gliched the game so that we could get a hidden filler pokemon that was literally unintelligible pixels and could break your game.

I stopped playing like halfway through the badge collection.

Before that was Black. Before that was Crystal (and before that, Red).

Crystal was the perfect Pokemon game to me. It had this new adventure with tons of new stuff, plus after you beat it, you could go back to the previous game's content and do that.

Black was alright. I enjoyed it and it felt like a next-gen (at the time) Pokemon game, but locking Pokemon away behind an arbitrary wall annoyed me.

r/robloxparents,"It deserves merit for the excellent job they did by spending tons of time highlighting what our eyes are attracted to and make that seem good. It's marvelous what they did with so little but in the end you still end up with little. The game requires more than is there and the developers clearly wanted more.  

When you play, the detail comes from the grass and the few characters present on screen.  
The background is a desert. In boss fights it'll just be a flat floor with a texture and basic bump map with almost nothing in the background, boss fights in the open the grass doesn't get rendered anymore or ofc it's in a literal desert with nothing but sand rendered. Just because the few resources available need to be reallocated to rendering the boss and the extra effects.  
Out in the open you also have to keep your vision close to stay immersed. There's a few trees and rocks strewn around but if you pay attention to them it only accentuates the lack of them. Objects even at medium distance are very washed out because of very aggressive LOD distances, too aggressive to stay immersed many times. [This](https://imgur.com/3ieP4lJ) was released just a year after [this](https://imgur.com/yVulzjE).  
And then there's ofc Korok forest where the switch gets diarrhea and the frame drops start happening.  

Playing BotW in 4k with modern shaders shows how badly the game has been treated by forcing it on Nintendo hardware. And that's just some superficial makeup without any actual intervention in the engine and maps that would have been possible.  
From a technical point it's a shame fans of Nintendo refuse to punish them so that they learn to make good hardware for their games and their developers again. The eras that made Nintendo famous are when they were also at the forefront of hardware performance. Now it's 2022 and you have to give people a friend code to have basic chat function with them.",2022-11-19,1668849577.0

r/robloxparents,"I'm able to dump my free time to indie games, but... I haven't seen that many absolute killers from indies.
So far I have seen games being on the level of the games that were built in flash or something, and played through browsers. 
Maybe they look and play more smoothly, but all the beats and the flow of those go straight for the spot that is marked with X, and so they are left being plain challenges, or only challenges.
Sure there are some games with stories, but so far I haven't seen any captivating ones.

They are bland timesinks with little bite.

I guess roguelikes and -lites have churned in the idea that games should be absolute challenges, and that seeps to other games too. 
I guess that works for developers who are working alone.
I realized that the best thing is if it's easy and fun game, and the fun can be anything from the emotional spectrum, but maybe no horror for me,and then how I see difficulty is that am I interested in playing the game and sticking through it, if I don't care about missing shots, but I still keep on playing as if there is no problem, then I call that easy.

It sounds silly to list Minecraft here, but it is captivating, or was? Still it's a game that gave boost to one genre of games, and I would love to see more genres. 

Last game I played was Cyberpunk 2077 and the unexpected happened. 
I cried. More than once.
It's a deck shuffle, and I got lost in it. 

Platformers for me were by naughty dog, and the old Spyro games, and Sims 2 on PS2, with kingdom hearts II, and Worms Mayhem. 
Last two were bit lighter compared to others mentioned. 
These were fun games, but then PC came over, and it has been bit dry since then. 
Fable, black and white 1 and 2, Populous: the Beginning, Dungeon Keeper 1 - 2, and RuneScape were the shots I enjoyed first on PC, then Roblox, Minecraft, and Terraria. League Of Legends was in between Minecraft and Terraria, and then Dota 2. First half, the classics were fun, but latter half doesn't necessarily have it. Minecraft is somewhere close, but that fits as a change. MOBA games were great with friends and that is it.

There are dimensions to be found, and I can't really see indies doing it as easy. You have to work for the games to crack into the core of it, and that is not as easy to play as one would like it.",2022-11-19,1668848483.0

I dont really consider Obsidian to be an indie producer, but they consistently churn out amazing RPGs. Some of these still look like they were released 10 years ago, but have phenomenal gameplay/writing. Larian is similar with thr Divinity Original Sin games.

Paradox is to some extent similar to your civ / cash grab example, but I still love them. Lots of new games, and unfortunately tons of DLC. Notorious for requiring the dlc to have the game even be playable on latsst patches. I think that has to be balanced vs the hours of playtime you can get out of them though.

Pretty sure SwSh, Arceus, and SV are popular because they’re more open world, they fit a little better visually with other similar styles out now, and they feel rather accessible.

r/robloxparents,"Wasn't a myth multiple people confirmed it. NPCs have copies of themselves in each map instance. This used to even be normal in old days with disk run games and others that couldn't stream data fast enough. You copied the data so it could load faster.

But that hasn't been required for any modern title, including on nintendo systems because storage in cartridges and hard drives is fast enough that there is no reason to do it.

But because Game Freak is developing game with methods 10-20 years behind the rest of the industry they do stupid things like that that are unnecessary. SV has at least a memory leak issue and it also isn't render the open world like a proper modern game it's rendering whole parts of the world it doesn't need to which is most likely one of the causes of the poor performance. A proper modern, basically any open world game made in the last 15 years, only renders what you can physically see and that's it. SV appears to render everything or at least the LOD of everything all the time and that is bad development.

That's always been the problem with pokemon since it went to the 3D era. Game Freak refuses to hire managers, leads, and developers who have experience in 3d  development so they are learning as they go along and since they are forced to get a new game out every 1-2 years they don't have enough time to actually learn anything.

And considering these games make GTAV look poor as well as Pokemon being the #1 media franchise on the planet there is absolutely no excuse other than incompetence and not giving a shit that they continue to not care. Can't even blame it on japanese development culture because literally every other Nintendo property has evolved and improved on the Switch EXCEPT Pokemon.",2022-11-19,1668832894.0

That's not what people are complaining about this gen. The game is literally one of the worst running games on the Switch. You can't even argue that it's the Switch's fault, when games like Xenoblade, BotW, and Mario all look and run better too (and have more going on at the same time).

r/robloxparents,"Well, I bought a physical card cause I generally dislike everything being digital, but I digress.

I'm an old fart now, but when pre-orders first came out it actually legitimately was to just secure a copy. So you're not wrong, I was more commenting that the whole point of a pre-order was to act more like a back order to ensure that the local game place had enough copies. So for me it was just kind of weird like I thought they wouldn't have copies for people who hadn't pre-ordered.

Also, oh my God, stop pre-ordering f****** games. You're loaning a software company money for software they haven't shipped.

It's crazy this idea of giving money before like services are rendered is wild. Like for example with Uber eats and the like You often are giving the tip to the driver, before they've even delivered the food. I mean like think about that, you could give them a tip they pick up your food poop in the bag and deliver it. And then Uber ask if you want to give an additional tip.

Whatever all I got to say is hold on to your money kids clout for day one gaming or weird skins and stuff, like I kind of understand it, I went to tamagotchi it's not like marketing and peer pressure hasn't got me. But nothing in this world comes free, when people just start throwing free stuff on top of something you're paying for it. You may not be paying physically more for the pre-order, but you're paying for it with free beta testing and a deleterious experience. Sorry this was a lot longer than I anticipated.

TL;DR yeah I get it We were agreeing",2022-11-19,1668840080.0
r/robloxparents,"How is it good?
  
It's as if Gamefreak *listened* to the vast majority of complaints in recent years.
  
Routes are too linear? Well, just to give an example, I spent *three hours* just exploring the first route fully before even making it to school, and exploration feels rewarding.
  
Pokemon look the best they ever have, even if environments don't.
  
We finally have a starter that turns into a monster instead of a roommate with a 9 to 5 job.
  
The story is really fun so far, and having the freedom to pursue different plotlines as you want is really cool, and give entirely different experiences: for example, to start off, one plot will have you go east and another has you go west. Each of these areas is equal in level but have completely different pokemon.
  
Terra dens are so much cooler than swsh raid dens, because every once in a while you'll find a mon with a Tera type that completely helps cover it's weakness.
  
As someone whose biggest complaint about the franchise has been overlevelling, I haven't experienced that *yet*. In fact, even with forced exp share, it feels like I have to fight every single trainer on a route and catch a bunch of pokemon just to get a level or two, since the ""let's go"" feature is completely optional.
  
Whether or not you like the designs of the new mons, they often are incredibly unique, have unique methods of evolution, and it's crazy the amount of regular mons that have signature moves, whether it's Pawmo's revive, one for each of charcadet's evos, maushold's multihit, etc.
  
the same can be said for cool, unique abilities, like Palafin and Wattrel.

r/robloxparents,"Mario and Zelda consistently innovated? 

Mario has lesser big titles year after year for the sake of its derivative spin offs. Big culprit being the New Super Mario Bros. series. Same game title after title. They even started re-releasing their titles with Mario Kart 8. Speaking of they hit Mario Party 8 before they did Mario Kart. MK came out way before Mario Party.

Zelda is even worse as they nailed the formula in Link to the Past back in 1991. Then they did a good job at translating it 3D but since then it's been mostly the same. Like with Mario's FLUDD they just took the same formula and added a gimmick on top. That worked back in the Gamecube days as the technological advance from console to console was much more apparant.

Now Nintendo came to the technological crossroads where their games have much more weigh to pull since the hardware side of things isn't doing anything.

Not to say their games are bad. I love Mario Odyssey amazing game and while Breath of the Wild is neat it feels held back by not only its hardware but gameplay too. 

You might be able to say that about Odyssey but the thing about that game is that it doesn't have any competition. Very few games out there are building on the grounds that Mario Galaxy laid let alone Mario 64.

Whereas Zelda there's a few more games 'vying' for its throne. Dark Souls series comes to mind. That game's combat is so good and it's basically the sequel of Wind Waker's combat so it feels sad that BotW's combat feels about as good as Wind Waker. FromSoft aren't one to sleep on their laurels too as they keep adding on to it title after title.

That's the strongest point in my view i think, but it's not like intuition on the level of a fighting game (like smash bros, for example) in which there's this constant like unconscious judgment of what the next right move is on a moment-to-moment basis, i suppose

i dont mean to imply that pokemon games *should* (or should be expected to) have that intuition style of gameplay; i just mean to list it as one of the things i find enjoyable in games in general, and that if a game lacks deep strategy and compelling narrative, then to me reaction time/intuition seems like the only thing that can compensate

>As for ""motivating narrative"" it's a Pokémon game, the narrative is to become the very best and become campion, as ever.

i dont see that as inherently being a motivating narrative; why care about becoming the champion if it doesnt feel like the odds are stacked against the playable character (the player themselves, if considering the playable character as a self-insert)?  Becoming the champion seems so easy and inevitable that it feels like there's nothing to 'prove', in a sense (like challenging a pre-school to a spelling bee), which i suppose wouldnt necessarily be bad if the playable character didnt seem like such a self-insert

i mean, give the playable character a personality and make them look excited about becoming champion, look disheartened when they encounter set-backs, and so on, and sometimes that is enough motivation for the player to want to act as a guiding force even if the game is very easy, i believe.  I think the game Little Misfortune is a good example of this, in which it seems easy and inevitable to 'win', but often still enjoyable to play because the player just wants to guide the playable character forward

>These are kids games, how much ""deep strategy"" do you want for a game that has a bunch of animals that can blast thunder out of their backsides?

as much as possible.  If it's too difficult, have an option in the main menu to artificially limit the opponent's stats, but not artificially limit the player's potential

Sure pvp is different and has a lot more mindgames and strategy, but most people don't get super into that and efficient pvp tactics are generally pretty underwhelming in pve.

I've been enjoying lots of plain action roguelite games as of late and there's tons of cheap low commitment, high intensity indie games hitting the mark on that. Sometimes the core is a deep rooted story, other times it's sp00ky horror, and other times it's just shootin dudes with guns.

Another thing to ponder is for the price commitment of a AAA game, you're more likely to get more out of it, but when it flops you really can feel like you were ripped off.

I think the key for AAA is to forget trailers, forget preorders, forget expensive paid dlcs. Just be like r/patientgamers and only aim for what you really think is the perfect fit.

I think the biggest issue today is that people have lots of disposable income, so they really kind of wing it with any type of purchase, which leads to the massive ""steam library of games one never played"" problem.

It'd be like eating out. When you are tight on money, you only look for a place worth every penny of what it offers. But when you are more well off, it becomes a ""Oh doesn't this place look nice guys? Want to try it?""",2022-11-19,1668854382.0

Game Freak has like around 160-170 employees, COD MWII had like 3k people working on it, Breath of the Wild had 300(+100 more to finish the game), and xenoblade had like 150 devs during Xenoblade2, while it now has almost 300 devs. (Sources: nintendolife, wikipedia, screenrant)

r/robloxparents,"I bought Jedi: Fallen Order because it was $7.50 and I had Steam wallet money left over from a gift card my sister got me for my birthday, that was my justification. I was honestly expecting to hate the gameplay, because I play on PC and prefer mouse and keyboard 100% of the time, and I'd heard it was similar to the Souls games... where I just couldn't get over the clunky mouse and keyboard controls. I also just love Star Wars, and wanted to play it even just for the lore. I did enjoy the gameplay, I just got bored after awhile and went back to my old favorites; TF2, Civ 4, Skyrim, a new Valheim server my friends started... They seemed more interesting than doing parkour to kill endless stormtroopers, lol. I'll probably come back to it in a few months for the story.

As for the other greats you mentioned... While I haven't had my eye on them all of the time, I've never seen RDR2 below $30, even on sale... the game is 4 years old, yet it's still full price? I know, that's the industry standard now (because people keep buying it), but it's just ridiculous.

I may not be completely consistent in why I buy some games and not others, but I'm generally hesitant to pay more than $30 for a single player game (I know RDR2 has *some* multiplayer, but it's not really the story side of things, right?), no matter how good it is. I will keep my eye on The Witcher 3 and RDR2, I have heard they're good.

Edit: and I've also played Stellaris and Surviving Mars from Paradox; they were interesting, but tbh, I found them to be less replayable than people often say (more true for Surviving Mars than Stellaris), and very basic quality of life stuff was just... Missing? Why do I not have a logbook of historic events in Stellaris? That was a feature of Civ in 2005, and probably the earlier games too, why are we going backwards?

It'd be wildly different, but I really feel like Pokemon needs to evolve if they're moving off handhelds and onto mainline consoles from here on out.

Good for them, but this is debunked by simply looking at the ROM data oneself, pulling the filesystem out via CTRTOOL, one can quite quickly confirm there aren't any duplicate model files.

Lillie has four model files in total; A overworld and cutscene/battle model for the long hair with hat and one for later in the game when she changes her hairstyle.

That's it. This rather flies in the face of the original claimant who said, what was it? 80 different copies of Lillie? And then people ""confirming"" the same.

What they actually saw were 80 actors for Lillie across various maps using a Map Editor tool that had recently been released at the time for Sun/Moon. They noticed there were visible models outside the actual Map area in many places, coinciding with the number of that character that appeared in various cutscenes on that map. They came to incorrect conclusions, however, because those are **not** copies of the model; they are merely actors on the map that reference the same model. This led to stuff like this, repeated, over and over:

""Instead of coding her models to be pulled from a single file they just copypasted them into every single map folder and file she was to appear in.""

Which flies in the face of the ROM. It's just a something made up to fit the narrative that these people basically made up due to their own inexperience with mapping tools.

The games are quite scuffed recently, but I suppose they work with the casual market who buys every other release and so doesn't burn out. Hopefully they do a jump like Namco did with their Tales series, which had a similar issue with Tales of Berseria, with Tales of Arise being a much bigger step up in graphics from Berseria, which at some points, yeah, did look a lot like Tales of the Abyss, a PS2 game, running in an emulator, despite being their second PS4 Tales game.

However, the meat itself has a really distinct, rich taste that can’t be found in many other places. The chef knows the seasoning mix could be better, but chooses not to improve it much because the flavor of the meat itself is the main driving force in the meal.

Still a good meal overall, but could be made way better if it was prepared with more care.

Studio A needs help to finish their product, studio B can still deliver a viable, if stunted, product while lending additional help to studio A. Short term profit driven thinking, but, profitable nonetheless.

To an extent, treyarch is a victim of their own success, and Warzone's. They do their job well enough that they are able to fill in the gaps where needed.

r/robloxparents,"Pokemon is only around 27 years old. Digimon was one of the oldest rivals, but they haven't released as consistently as Pokemon (both games and shows), have games with very different mechanics from each other, and don't consistently churn out new digimon all the time, they actually reuse them very often. Pokemon's sheer numbers in terms of collection and media is very difficult to beat for potential rivals.

Pokemon fans as a whole are like cod and fifa fans. They just buy the next release regardless. The formula by itself is good enough for them. And the brand is the most powerful pull of them all. It's got a multi billion dollar company backing it after all.

The version difference gimmick is not something just anyone else can consistently pull off since they've been grandfathered in, which essentially doubles sales for very little work. That encourages purchases in a way that just having two people buy the same game wouldn't, because you need the second copy to ""complete"" your game instead of just being a different way to play.

And actually, there are a ton of derivative works. Some custom made ROM hacks, some games straight up rip off of Pokemon or are basically Pokemon but without decades of minor refinements and without nearly the same size audience. They're on a variety of different platforms, from Steam to mobile to random downloads.

Now if we’re taking about the expectations for such a successful franchise, I agree - I’d like to see more.

I know Nintendo will not focus on powerful hardware, probably never again, but we as consumers should send them a message that enough is enough and they can’t just ride on their legacy laurels forever.

Sony and Microsoft are publishing their first party titles on PC (after a certain time, sometimes at the same time from MS), they hold constant sales for their games, they have great online features, great hardware, etc. Nintendo can’t figure out (or is unwilling to) give us basic features like voice chat, a easy to use friends system, achievements, a mobile app to manage your accounts, GODDAMN SALES ON YOUR FIRST PARTY GAMES!

r/robloxparents,">Tons of great AAA games released in the past 10 years.

Besides the fact that in my opinion a game should be measured for its ability to be fun first and foremost, I would argue exactly as many good AAA games came out as did Indies. Honestly, just look at this thread, and it's not even the first time. Cyberpunk 2077 took a year to become what it is now, Bethesda is always derided for the state of their games as well. A lot of the AAA releases this year are also either sequels or remakes, so not a lot of originality coming from that end. Plus they've really narrowed their scope down to only a few genres. When is the last time a AAA horror game came out? I don't mean like resident evil either, I mean something that actually makes you afraid. Dead Space franchise maybe, Alien Isolation? These are pre pandemic releases. It's mostly been open world shooters, corridor shooters, brawlers, and the occasional one off adventure like The Last of Us. You also can't forget that CD Project Red at the time of releasing The Witcher 3 was considered an indie studio and they delivered The Witcher franchise which is a top tier franchise for just about everyone. Fromsoftware was also an indie studio during the beginning of the Soulsbourne franchise. No Man's Sky is straight up an indie game with a AAA scope on release.

Sure there are a lot of poor indie games, but I disagree that there are less great indie games than AAA games. There are quite a few great titles for indie games, and there are also quite a few AAA games that shit the bed.",2022-11-19,1668878141.0

r/robloxparents,"Everything you've said is relatable and I won't outright say you're out to lunch on any of it.

Some things that may or may not be interesting for you:

Setting up a controller on PC is not expensive at all. I think I paid $40 for my Logitech F710 and that's opened a gigantic world of ports, emulators, modern 3rd person action games (soulsborne specifically, though even 2D games like hollow knight I found dramatically more playable on controller despite being a long-time kbm player - and kbm is still my 'preferred' mode for fps, rts, strategy, etc)

If you weight by playtime, and know you're getting quality, is it really the end of the world to pay more for a single player game? RDR2 and W3 in particular, the playtime is LOOOOOONG. Unless you're in the distant minority where these games don't click for you, paying a couple multiples of your $30 benchmark isn't bad. Generally with indie games, I find the playtime is much lower, even if it's an awesome experience throughout. There are lots of exceptions of course, and there are many indie games I love. Buying Witcher 3 or RDR2 for $60 gives you more net playtime/utility than the equivalent dollar value in indie games in general, most of the time (not always).

Surviving Mars is a bit of a black sheep in the Paradox world -- I couldn't get into it myself despite having thousands of hours on their other games. Stellaris is definitely one of those games you need the DLC to get the proper experience, and that's a real con, but if we take the playtime weighting logic above, it ends up being quite worth it especially if you strategically buy the dlc when it's regularly on sale. Not a monetization model I'm in love with or think is ideal, but the full game is the bomb, and $60 wouldve never really been a realistic MSRP to buy the full package given the amount of dev time and quality involved in the final product.",2022-11-19,1668875587.0

In general, I'm glad I got it. My kid is having a blast, but I'm not going to tell him about the next generation of games release. If he is into pokemon, then I'll buy it, but I'm not going out of my way to get him into a franchise that is just about milking money with inferior products.

r/robloxparents,"To be fair Dark Soul's combat system is more akin to OoT. My point being they both stem from the same place. Except Zelda hit a wall once it got to Wind Waker. Both have Lock-on on system, you can dodge and roll around enemies. While it might seem basic it was enough for a while. FromSoft took that model and expanded it with their multiple games this and the previous gen. 

In Nintendo's case they released about as many 3D Zelda with very little advancement. Wind Waker was a step in the right direction. They added combos, parries and let you pick up weapons. Then once Nintendo got backlash for WW they decided to take a step back with Twilight Princess and recreate OoT which is as derivative as it gets. Now BotW is the peak of their work. Its combat doesn't hold a candle to FromSoft. Worst part is that DS combat is known to be good as every other game tries to emulate it. It just looks bad on nintendo as if they're still stuck behind. 

And yes most 3D Zelda boil down to the same even non 3D. Doesn't mean it's a bad thing as you could say the same with FromSoft but from a title to title, peer to peer perspective it treats its players with respect. There's only up and that up isn't only relative to the small castle they've built.

But I do play Zelda and if you want to know this is how samey I feel they are. Ocarina of Time is basically Link to the Past. Wind Waker too but with a boat at least this one has great art design and gameplay and felt ahead of its time. TP as mentionned above was nostalgia for OoT. Skyward Sword I guess was a step in the right direction but its execution was even more derivative due to revisiting dungeons so many times and everything else started to feel stale by this point.

It's clear Zelda was due for a change up. Even Nintendo knew as they took their sweet time and almost skipped a console for BotW. They could only ride gimmicks for so long you know... OoT with a dog, OoT with a boat and they would even double down on gimmicks with OoT with a bird and motion controls. Most of these gimmicks were hit or miss. Best gimmicks? OoT and LttP. I wonder why, huh?

I find it odd you're stunned by my comparison I thought Dark Soul's Zelda inspiration was obvious. One of the reasons I love the former even.",2022-11-19,1668844806.0

r/robloxparents,"It improves on what Arceus did in every way imo.  The open world feels genuinely open. You actually have freedom to go just about anywhere rather than being roadblocked for progression reasons. It feels more like old Bethesda games where the only thing that keeps you confined is that new areas are likely to be a much higher level than your team.

The multiplayer elements leave a BIT to be desired; so far we’ve learned that other players can’t see gym trials or gym battles in progress, but we can see other battles just fine. Starting a multiplayer session is a little weird as all the players get teleported to the last center the host used, but the other players aren’t locked to the host and are free to travel anywhere in the entire region.

Riding Koraidon feels…fine? I haven’t unlocked his other movement modes but it feels okay to me. They tied the ability to jump directly to riding so even though by default it isn’t much faster than on-foot he’s still the best way to get around.

There have been a lot of quality of life improvements. You can access the box anywhere, there’s an “autoheal” function where you select a pokemon and automatically heal their HP with items rather than having to manually select items. The camping system from SwSh returns as a picnic system. Basically the same thing with a little more customization, and the food now gives lasting and customizable buffs; still grants XP and heals the party.

Neither me nor anyone in my household has seen graphical glitches like this pic; just some weird framerate stuff impacting NPCs beyond a small radius around the player.

The battle animations and catching animations are the best they have ever been. The grass looks the most realistic it ever has. The dynamic rain looks good and your character looks wet in it.

During the years he tried different cuts never abandoning the seasoning that made him famous. After 20 years, the world explored new cuts and new breeds, and the chef jumped in, not because he studied the new frontier of meat knowledge, but because he wants to look modern, up-to-date. So you go to his fancy restaurant with 90ies-21century design, full of neon, fake plants, Keith Haring pictures, Britney Spears in the background.

For 5 star characters, the soft pity goes from wish 75-79. With a guaranteed 5 star character or weapon at 90. If you don't get the banner character in the first 90, you're guaranteed to get it in the next 90.

With this knowledge, it's very easy to save and/or pull accordingly to get exactly who you want when their banner releases. If you're a free player, you can't get everyone, but you *will* get 5 star characters over time and you can guarantee you get the ones you want.

r/robloxparents,"I appreciate the recommendation on the controller, but I just don't enjoy playing on standard controllers. I think it's a combination of having a computer to play games on, rather than consoles, most of my childhood... And then my first console I did have was the Wii. So an XBox/Playstation looking controller is just so alien to me... And I'm strongly left handed. I avoided shooter games for years because my right hand wasn't very accurate on the mouse, then TF2 taught me to ""aim with the keys,"" and my mouse control improved in those types of games over time. My left hand roams over 3/4ths of the keyboard, even when I'm typing... I can't do that with a controller though. I loved the Wii controller for that reason; the nunchuk did like, 3 things, while my dominant, left hand did the rest! It was great! ... And it has ruined me for basically every console since. I know, I'm an odd duck.

Here's the thing: I play a lot of single player games already to unwind, and justifying buying new single player games when I have multiplayer games I want to enjoy with friends... I guess the money issue is how I tell myself, ""no, you don't need a new game, you still haven't tried France's Unique Historical Victory in Civ 4: Rhye's and Fall of Civilization, or finished your pure mage build you started in Skyrim... You're gonna actually make it to Solstheim this playthrough, right?? And then I forget about the existence of other single player games, lol.

I have nearly 2000 hours in Civ 4's different versions on Steam (mostly the base game and BTS)... And I've only owned it on Steam for maybe 8 years, before that I had it on an iMac and I sunk sooo much time into that. I know the value of a game with a deep story and lots to do. Maybe I'm just stubborn, or already stuck in my ways, and not spending any more money on games is an excuse not to experience new things... But I just did 3 quests in Skyrim yesterday that I'd never done before, so I'm not just spinning my wheels quite yet!

I understand Paradox's model, and they deliver a good product. I know they have to pay the bills, and releasing paid expansions with defined new content is the most fair way for them to be able to make money on their games. I'm certainly very grateful they don't engage in battlepasses, lootboxes, in-game purchasable currencies, and so on, not that it would really work for their type of games, but if they wanted to, they could find a way. If EA ever buys Paradox, we'd find out... I have been looking into Crusader Kings, but it'll probably be awhile; I've trained myself to wait for Steam sales, and enjoy the *many* games I've already spent money on, heh.

I personally think it's a step in the right direction for Pokemon as a whole with this game coming, out they can see people talking about the massive lag, but at the same time we get a good game that has in my opinion a compelling story and world to explore.   
While yes some of the texturing leaves a lot to be desired, but to sit there and say that the game is bad and is worthy of being skipped because of texturing is really unfair in my opinion to an otherwise good game. But when all people say is, this game looks like shit, or say things like this series is going down the shitter, it does nothing but put a bad label on the game, thus when they look to make another game they'll scale back a lot of the things that I and a lot of people I know love about the game and all it has to offer.  
It seems that people want a lot out of a Pokémon game but when we get most of what we wanted, those same people just seem to nitpick things on 5 year old hardware.

Like, you beat the gyms challenge but the E4 is just a single room with recicled npcs. You beat Team Star but the final boss is supposed to be a plot twist even tho it's very obvious from the very beginning. You defeat totem/alpha/whatever they are called pokémon but the final boss is like ""Oh btw this is a plot twist, also this person is now dead, also Luke I am your father, also now I am defeated bye lol"" (not actual spoilers, just to give the idea) in the span of 20 minutes. About battle animations, they are a bit more like Arceus but contact moves don't make contact anymore, so you don't see your pokémon rushing against the enemy when using close combat and such. I still had fun and I find the characters interesting, but I had to ignore all the game breaking glitches, the terribile graphics, the non-existent settings (no set mode, no disabile battle animations, no exp share toggle) and so on.

It started with outright lies and fraud, and everyone just kinda let it slide for YEARS until they could finally put in the bits they had originally promised, but everything they've done has been reactionary at best, and nearly everything required multiple passes to polish it to be non-broken. I distinctly recall being able to simply fall out of your ship, after finding a non-clipping section of floor, and because it's absolutely not any kind of space simulation, you just fall down away from your ship in space. There's no thrusters, there's no stopping the fall, because the game never did anything but give you flat levels with presumed gravity at all times, even in your ship. You can still do this now! Building your ship, it's totally easy to just make a spot where you can fall off the side if you go over the half-meter railing. And good luck getting back up if you haven't already built several upgrades for the jetpack!

There is a reason DQ Treasures was changed from a Monsters game.",2022-11-19,1668843971.0
r/robloxparents,"Wait, but isn’t your style of only catching the Pokémon you want literally an argument for having the entire Dex in? Because then it doesn’t matter if there’s 500 or 1000, you can catch the Pokémon you want from whichever generation and the rest of the game has more varied content in every respect. 

And to be fair, I think that Pokémon games usually have so much grinding that “catching them all” even with such a large roster wouldn’t be so bad  if the overal design of the spawn curve was improved. 

Think of it this way: 5000 battles, with 500 Pokémon, or 5000 battles with 1000 Pokémon but an different spawn curve that results in the same end result as the former option.

I really don’t see why more Pokémon is ever bad, for both collectors and non collectors. People who catch them all are gonna fight the same Pokémon multiple times in their search. People who don’t are gonna miss their favourite Pokémon.

In a series where Pokémon really aren’t much more than numbers behind a model that don’t actually play diferent in meaningful enough ways… I just don’t understand the “bloat” argument, it’s just non-logical.",2022-11-19,1668846967.0
r/robloxparents,I think by the end of scarlet I caught about 250 and I was done after that. 400 is actually a pretty achievable grind goal and I probably wouldn't want more than 500 in any one game.,2022-11-19,1668840084.0

The concepts are out there. It just feels odd that they decide not to adhere to them. It's like they're in their own bubble. Which doesn't always go their way.

I find it odd how people claim Zelda and Dark Souls are **nothing** alike. I got the same sense of adventure in DS that I got from Zelda, even better too. In DS you can literally play with a sword and shield and the combat is the same but better. They're not alike because DS does so much but they still have the same base.

Dark Souls is what Zelda should strive for in the same sense Hollow Knight did with Super Metroid. I guess people are offended because in the former case it's an icon being targeted.

It is kinda cute tho how you think that the type variety and ""complexity"" automatically means that it is challenging. 
Yes there are many types. Have I ever bothered to properly play into type advantages of disadvantages since XY came out? No. Because it was arbitrary. Types don't really matter if you are always several levels ahead of the opponent and that without training in grass or anything. You just naturally become overleveled just by playing the game as intended, because they want it to be easy.

Also even if you personally don't care about the graphics, the fact that it looks so bad and empty compared to older games on the same console, or even older ones, is just reason enough to see that they aren't just worth the time and money, since they don't put the effort.

Wii: 

> After the success of Gekko, IBM presumably grabbed this design and re-branded it as ‘750CL’ for other manufacturers to use [3]. Then, when Nintendo requested a new CPU to use with their new console, still known as ‘Revolution’ (hence the RVL prefix on their stock motherboards), IBM and Nintendo agreed to use a 750CL clocked 1.5 times the speed of Gekko. This CPU is known as Broadway [4] and runs at 729 MHz.

> After having reviewed Gekko, I’m afraid there aren’t many changes found in the new CPU. However, this may be an advantage: GameCube developers were able to start developing their new Wii games right away thanks to all the experience they gained with Gekko. Moreover, the fact that Broadway runs 1.5x the original speed will allow them to push for more features and quality.

Wii U

> In the end, IBM grabbed three Broadway CPUs, stepped up the clock to 1.24 GHz and wrapped them with extra L2 cache and the necessary circuitry to arbitrate bus contention and cache coherency (so it doesn’t have to be done with software). That’s Espresso.

And yes, to some extent, it should obviously be noted Elden Ring was created with 4K graphics and an ultra high fidelity lighting, particles and physics system with high quality animations while BOTW looks like it was made on Dreams. This is why Pokémon looks like it was made for a GameCube. Nintendo locks content behind licensing deals and the quality suffers greatly. If they still make a game every few years that you enjoy, good for you. I’m not bootlicking them for it. Again, I don’t care if people enjoy BOTW over a Souls game. More power to them. But it takes some Stockholm syndrome to tell yourself these games are getting as much love, care, attention, and effort as others. It’s a predatory system. Can’t afford a PS5?

r/robloxparents,"It’s a good game, its mechanics are good. People enjoy it. In fact it’s probably one of the best games ever made. That does not change the fact the core of the game involves little effort compared to nearly any other AAA release. It was clever in the same way Minecraft or Tetris are. They aren’t technically sophisticated but they’re still good.

What Nintendo has been doing is pushing out technically limited games on expensive hardware that largely follow the format of all their predecessors. Pokémon, Mario, Sonic. These are lacking games that have seen next to no evolution because they don’t need to. If you want to play with that IP, you’ll have to buy a switch to do it.

I’ve owned a switch. I’ve played games on it. They aren’t all bad games. I am saying the quality is inherently lacking. Witcher 3, an old game that needed significant visual downgrades to perform on the switch, and was sold at the same price as other platforms. BOTW looks like a game from the early 2000s. It’s gameplay is good, absolutely nothing else about it is exceptional. It’s totally lacking in all other aspects.

Critics have a soft spot for Nintendo anyway. This latest Pokémon release, one of the most lacking, least innovative, worst looking games that will go platinum of frankly the entire 2010s as well as 2020s got, on average, a 7/10. Nintendo games are seen as *the* classic gaming format with beloved thirty year old franchises. They could put out an isometric reboot of Emerald tomorrow that only changes the pixel art and get 8s and 9s. I mean for Christsake, the game runs poorly on the only hardware it was designed for by a team that has developed tons of games for that hardware.

>The quality of what?

Their games?

>What’s locked behind licensing deals?

Oh, let’s see. Uhhh. Pokémon. Kirby. Mario. Sonic. Smash Bros. Legend of Zelda. Animal Crossing, and a host of other things. Basically every significant IP they own. It’s an anti-consumer practice to force you to overpay for their incredibly underwhelming console.

>Which games have suffered from this happening?

Literally all of them, which all have graphics from the 90s, that all use the same formula they always have with little exception, that never go on sale. I mean you aren’t to be the only one that disputes this. You’re the first person I’ve ever seen to imply the quality does not deteriorate due to this. I mean check out just how few games the switch has!

Look at any other franchise in this world. Even when other companies like Sony or Microsoft do exclusives, it’s almost always for a limited time. They usually release on other platforms besides their revival. If god of war were a Nintendo property or had a Nintendo licensing deal, it would look exactly the same as it did in 2011. It would play the same. It would have the same mechanics. What are considered revolutions in Nintendo games are your standard yearly feature improvements in notable franchises.

Nintendo has sold four times as many Switch systems as PS5 and XBSX’s combined. People want to develop for them. Nintendo won’t let them so it won’t saturate their sales for their own IP. Despite this, the select amount of third party games they *do* allow on their system generally constitute the best games they offer. The downgraded, old gen games from consoles. That is easily the best evidence.",2022-11-20,1668905324.0

 >There are a lot of high quality kids content, why settle with low quality ones?

Interesting that you ignore every single argument except the one you could superficially tackle. You think that this is a gotcha! its not. The issue is not that there is a lack of quality content. 

 3 seperate people have tried to explain this to you. Lets try it real slow for you: KIDS. LIKE. DIFFERENT. THINGS. THAN. ADULTS.THEY. LACK. EXPERIENCE. AND. MATURITY. THAT. COMES. WITH. AGE. THEY. HAVE. UNDER. DEVELOPED. BRAINS. AND. LIKE. LESS. COMPLEX. THINGS. TODDLERS. LIKE. PEPPA PIG. 10 YEAR. OLDS. DO. NOT. LIKEWISE. 10 YEAR. OLDS. HAVE. DIFFERENT. STANDARDS. THAN. ADULTS. THEY. LACK. EXPERIENCE. KNOWING. WHAT. IS. GOOD. AND. WHAT. THEY. LIKE. THEY. NEED. TO. BE. ALLOWED. TO. EXPLORE. THEIR. INTERESTS. SO. THEY. CAN. REFINE. THEM.   STOP. GATEKEEPING. WHAT. PEOPLE. SHOULD. OR. SHOULD. NOT. FIND. FUN. EVEN. IF. YOUR. OPINION. IS. DIFFERENT. SOME. KIDS. LOVE. POKEMON. SCARLET. AND. VIOLET. EVEN. WITH. ITS. DEEP. FLAWS. LET. THEM!

Idk. Do you enjoy watching peppa pig with a cold beer or wine after a hard days work? Probably not. 
All of that doesnt even matter. Except for the gatekeeping part. All that matters is if someone buying the new pokemon game actually enjoy it. Kid or not. Its up to the individual if the price is worth it or not. Many people do think its worth it. I do not. I think its abysmal, every cut corner possible, moneygrabby and exploiting a loved franchise because its still an experience that is hard to find elsewhere. my personal opinion matters not. Where other people get their joy from is none of my business. How much they are willing to pay for that joy is not my problem. *THAT* is the issue. That you just do not seem to be able to understand.  You should not have to accept low quality kids content but you should not force them to engage with what you *think* is good quality content either. Thats up to the child to determine. 


>I wouldn't allow my kids watching MLP, that's for sure.

 Ironically modern MLP is fantastic kid content. If you are actually a parent, i can't imagen you spend a lot of time with them, talk to them or understand them at all. Exploring different experiences and making mistakes is how we grow. Not allowing your kids to watch something they are interested in and is appropriate (for the individual child, they are all different after all) is *actually* problematic. Unlike letting them explore interests even if you personally do not see the appeal. I grew up next to a family that put their kids in a bubble. They had no tv because the parents thought it rotted the youths brain ( not unlike how you think allowing a kid to play this pokemon game is spoiling them or ""letting them eat shit because they enjoy it"" ). Amongst other media they stopped their kids from using. So when eventually they were let loose in the world, they were not prepared. They did not get to try out things in a safe space with a parent to guide them and explain. They had not gathered any of their experience's. No likes or dislikes. But they were hungry to find them. So they tried everything. Having to catch up to their non closeted peers. But without a solid fundation and safe space to return to. Every single one of them landed with bad people and struggeld with some form of substance abuse. Anecdotes are not proof ofcourse. But preventing kids from making less than ideal choices does not actually help them. Guiding them through it, does. Letting them watch MLP or what they are interested in and then letting them watch  Miyazaki would. Let them find out what they like instead of telling them what to like.",2022-11-20,1668925186.0

>to that, then maybe we'll actually see better quality stuff

Better quality to whom? I looked through your post history to find an example, i normally do not like doing that but i find it fitting in this case. I saw you like gran turismo and have played genshin impact.  Racing games are the bottom of the barrel gaming wise. Even worse than pokemon s and v. All you do is drive a car. I can do that in grand theft auto 5 and do much more. Genshin is just a worse version of breath of the wild and with lootboxes. People who play games with lootboxes in their games are corporate shills for gaming companies. Both of these games are low quality games. If only people did not support these bad low quality games, we could have some better quality games. This is just my opinion*. And by your own logic that makes you pro-gran turismo and pro-genshin which means you are comparible to a less dangerous anti-masker. 

Everything has already been said. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. So instead i am going to leave you a piece of advice: when people tell you, you are wrong. You do not need to take them at face value. But you should humble yourself for just a moment and pretend that you *are* wrong. And at least understand the position of the people calling you wrong. So that you are actually having the same conversation. (You consistantly do not understand what people are trying to explain to you. Which leads to your arguments to not relate to what people are trying to tell you.) Allow some introspection. Allow for the possibility that you misunderstood what is being said. We have said some mean things to each other. You might not realise it. But i am trying to help you understand. Do with that as you will.

 Come back to me when you get a kid or engage with one. We shall see how long your ""way"" lasts. Just be honest with yourself. You have no experience with kids. Yet, you proclaim to know how to do it better. There is no way for me to know that right? But you should ask yourself that question. if you in fact do not have any experience.

Everything has already been said. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. So instead i am going to leave you a piece of advice: when people tell you, you are wrong. You do not need to take them at face value. But you should humble yourself for just a moment and pretend that you *are* wrong. And at least understand the position of the people calling you wrong. So that you are actually having the same conversation. (You consistantly do not understand what people are trying to explain to you. Which leads to your arguments to not relate to what people are trying to tell you.) Allow some introspection. Allow for the possibility that you misunderstood what is being said.",2022-11-21,1668996078.0

r/robloxparents,"What you don’t seem to realize is that what makes a game good or bad is based on opinion. I tie good and bad to my individual enjoyment/experience. You tie good and bad to overall quality + quality relative to comparisons. When you say the game is objectively bad “based on facts” you are implying that I should decide the game is bad based on your opinion, regardless of my own. And that I’m objectively wrong if I don’t. You don’t need to like or even respect my, and others, opinion(s). But you do need to acknowledge them.

Facts are facts, and much more important than opinions in general. Though with art/entertainment I feel that opinions are more important.

A game is not good or bad independent of the individual player’s opinion of it.

To use your example of The Room. It has been out long enough and discussed enough that it is generally accepted as a bad movie. However that does not make it objectively bad, because there could be people out there who genuinely think it is good. They’re not wrong, just in the minority. How can a movie be factually/objectively bad? What is the set in stone criteria independent of an individual’s opinion? And how are those criteria “graded” independent of an individuals opinion?

I don’t mean to argue semantics, but semantics are the issue here, not the game. People aren’t defending Pokémon Scarlet. They are defending their opinions. If you put yourself in a position where you are presenting your opinion as the only correct option you will find people around you become very defensive. That is your fault, not theirs.

I wish I get it, but all I hear is “I have to justify making things worse for everyone because I can’t control my kids at all and apparently they have to get the things they want with disregard that it makes things worse for everyone.” That’s all I’m getting.

And yes, I’m aware about letting your kid try the things they want. But I feel that there are times that that notion has to be sacrificed for things to get better. If parents sacrifice making their children happy for like a month, maybe we’ll get better games, that kind of thing. It works for other things as well - maybe if iPhone sales went down from parents not buying their kids iPhones, we might get less iPhone copies (like how it is with phone makers copying iPhone nowadays) and more good stuff.

Us on the east do such things every time, and now we’re getting better than people on the west shores.

I can give you another example, I had a lot of fun playing ""ride to hell retribution"" with my siblings, even tho it's the most broken piece of garbage out there (check youtube if you don't belive me), and no one can argue that it's quality is abysmal and not worth the money. Same principle applies with this game, something that technically broken, and behind the times in the RPG genre, is objectively a bad product for the $60 price, I could understand if it was $20, but as it is it's just not worth the money.

You ask why someone would buy Pokémon for $60 when they could buy something “better” for the same price. Because they will personally enjoy the Pokémon experience more, because it’s Pokémon. Or something else they like about the game. That could be nostalgia, just their preference, or something else. Either way, it is their opinion.

Do you really not see how you are trying to force your definition of “perceived” quality (which is a whole other argument some people could try to make) as the only correct way of assessing an opinion on a game?

your definition is flat out wrong my dude, like I told you, there is a way we can objectively judge things, it has nothing to do whether you enjoy something or not.

>in my opinion the Witcher 3 is a bad game

that's taste and like you said personal opinion, but again, there's ways we can objectively judge games, be it the amount of content it has, price, performance, availability, gameplay, mod support or even graphics. And the witcher 3 sweeps the floor with pokemon on all of these categories.

>You ask why someone would buy Pokémon for $60 (...) Because they will personally enjoy the Pokémon experience more

Like I said, if they enjoy it that's fine. The problem starts when they start presenting something subjective like their opinions as a base to judge objectively if the game is good/worth or not.

>Do you really not see how you are trying to force your definition of “perceived” quality as the only correct way of assessing an opinion on a game?

yes, and it should be forced because it's the standard when we try to see if a game is good for a reason. We can't judge things with subjective stuff like opinions because there is no accounting for taste.",2022-11-22,1669093225.0

What began as me trying to state that a form of entertainment cannot be objectively bad due to good/bad being based on opinion, has become an entertaining and accidental social experiment where we see the lengths someone will go to in order to present their opinion as superior by ascending it from an opinion to fact (perhaps even a law of the universe) by channeling close-mindedness into veiled self-righteousness.

I understand that there are ways to objectively measure things. My point is how do you use those objective measurements to rate something good or bad without involving someone’s opinion? Who determines that a game that takes less than 10 hours to beat is a bad thing? Who determines that a game above 30 fps is good thing? Who determines that lack of mod support is a bad thing? And most importantly, who determines what weight to place on these different factors when determining the overall rating of the game? Who does all of that, and how do they do it without inserting an opinion?",2022-11-22,1669136596.0
r/robloxparents,">the entire idea of rating something is based on opinion 

yes, and because I don't know the reviewer's taste, I go directly to read the objective information in the categories I listed, the best reviewers start like that and usually finish with their opinion of the game which is just the cherry on top.

A strangers opinion is not relevant when grading a game because you don't know them, it's not the same as if I asked a friend or my brother if they recommend a game based on their opinion, because I'll know if I like it or not if they did because we have similar tastes.

>Who determines that a game that takes less than 10 hours to beat is a bad thing? Who determines that a game above 30 fps is good thing? Who determines that lack of mod support is a bad thing? (...) who determines what weight to place on these different factors when determining the overall rating of the game? Who does all of that, and how do they do it without inserting an opinion?

most of these are answered by common sense and are either black or white, opinion is not taken into account, for example a $60 dollar game lasting 3 hours is inexcusable for obvious reasons, a game running bellow 30 fps starts running into engine problems (specially if it's multiplayer or has coop), a lack of mod support is bad (for multi-platform releases) and the reason should be obvious, the weight of each of these categories falls on the reader and in a clear cut case like the latest pokemon game, the outcome should be obvious, if you have common sense that is, something I'm suspecting is not as common with pokemon fans lol.

no, that interpretation is just wrong and kind of a big leap on my logic, like I said if we remove opinion from the equation, just the facts remain (the game runs at stable 30 fps or not, etc), and that's how we can judge things objectively, and using this universal method, you can obviously see how objectively bad the new pokemon game is.",2022-11-23,1669225070.0

And placing equal weight on those categories is very much an opinion, certainly not removing opinion from the equation like you claim. Game 1 is 1 hour long, completely bug free, consistently stays above 30 fps,but no mod support. Game 2 has 50 hours of gameplay and mod support, but is riddled with bugs and struggles to maintain 30 fps. Both are $30. They are relatively equal in comparison as “objectively” good/bad games?

 Your entire “opinionless” rating system breaks down when held under any kind of scrutiny because it is lacking the one critical ingredient of rating art (which video games fall under), opinion.

It’s fine if you’re talking about grading a multiple choice test where there are right and wrong answers. But even something like and aircraft passing a safety test is still based on a set of safety standards based on a group of peoples opinion of what is considered acceptable risk vs unacceptable risk. Granted it is a government backed opinion that most, if not all people respect, it is still an opinion.

To that point, excluding safety standards altogether (removing opinion) one aircraft can be objectively less likely to explode than another aircraft. Another aircraft can be objectively less likely to have its wings fall off than the other. Which aircraft is objectively safer? EVEN IF you could make that distinction, which safety categories do you take into consideration, and how much weight do you place on them? When deciding if an aircraft is objectively safe? I would argue that there are people who feel that just by being an aircraft it is unsafe. That is their opinion, you can argue that there is less than a 1 in a million chance any safety issue will arise on their flight, but they won’t feel safe. Does that make them objectively wrong?

It’s not that I don’t understand what you are saying. It only seems that way to you because you refuse to acknowledge the points I’m making to point out the inconsistencies in your point of view.
