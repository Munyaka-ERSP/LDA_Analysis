r/roblox,"Concerned parents: Roblox scams, and cash grab games that pretty much force children to rebuy game packs they already own.
Ok, so the title says it all. I am sick of seeing all these games that are clearly a cash grab, and I have been blind to it until recently checking what my son has been begging for Robux for. Take for example Ninja Legends 2. These guys just put some shine on the original game and put a number 2 at the end of it. There is nothing new about the second game!! I just checked it myself on my sons tablet.

Why do the people who run Roblox let this stuff fly? Games like this only rename their original game and call it new so it forces children to re buy the same packs they already had, and the sad part is, many of these small children fall for it and beg their parents to buy them Robux to pay for something they already got..... its highway robbery. Something needs to be done about this soon. Roblox seems to be getting worse with all the Robux scams I need to constantly monitor that my kid is not falling for and now I have to make sure game creators are not ripping my kids off. I, and many parents in my community are going to start stepping up soon to try getting news out about this if something is not done soon. This stuff has to stop, and you need to stop letting people like this take advantage of children.

Edit: Forgot to add that I also play some games with my children on Roblox like Bee Swarm Simulator and a couple others, so this is how I know when I am seeing a scam, or something fishing going on.

UPDATE: Ok so I got what I needed from this thread, I will still stop in and reply once in a while, and I will just leave it here for people to discuss among themselves their experiences with games on the platform. People tell me I am wrong, but there is a reason this thread has so many up votes and support in the comments. Only people telling me im wrong are kids who like the game, or the studios goons they send to down vote and trash talk the thread. Parents are starting to remove their kids from the Roblox platform, and justly so. They are no longer a safe platform for children as they once were. When children are targets of greedy adults and corporations, it's time to do something about it!!",2021-01-06,1609913648.0
r/roblox,"Roblox (the corporation) doesn't exactly control the games on Roblox (the platform). They can moderate and remove games, but having excessive microtransactions is merely a bad practice and is nothing worthy to get a game removed, rather this is left up to the Roblox economy to decide.

[Anyways here's a link to a relevant topic by another Roblox game developer that you might be interested in](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/kq7k60/please_stop_with_the_simulators_are_bad_and_easy/)",2021-01-06,1609916801.0
r/roblox,"this is something i can agree with, its seriously BS. thing is, you can quite easily give people (who bought the 1st game's gamepasses) special perks in the new game (survive the disasters  1/2 for example, you get free gear in the newer game), so they can quite easily credit those who bought gamepasses for the first game, they just choose to ignore it because more sales = more money. pretty common trait in simulator games, the gamepasses are 100% optional, but they give such an insane advantage compared to other players, its eventually mandatory to buy them. Bubblegum Simulator is a prime target for this. 2x hatch speed, 2x luck, multi egg hatches, auto resource collect (totalling at around 2-3k robux). honestly such a disappointing turn for roblox games IMO. take this with a grain of salt since i've never played ninja legends 1 or 2, and probably dont plan on it.",2021-01-06,1609924976.0
r/roblox,Thats pretty much every simulator in a nutshell in roblox,2021-01-06,1609914162.0
r/roblox,"Basically...


All these ""simulator"" games are mostly the same thing. It is a business practice. Child play game, game get too hard, then they buy stuff for robux to make it easier. Like the other commenters said, there isn't much the staff at ROBLOX can do about it. It is, essentially, making ROBLOX money too, since there is a cut of the robux purchases made in games going to roblox staff, so maybe that is why they won't moderate these simulator cash grabs.

What can YOU do about it?

Not much. Teach your child that maybe these games aren't worth their time. Maybe help them survey the site and see any other interesting games your child might play. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you.

As for the sequel thingy:

As far as I have seen, this is a mildly rare occurance of repackaged games made sequels. So this is one of those rare occurrences, don't worry about that too much.",2021-01-06,1609926943.0
r/roblox,"This kind of thing has been happening since time immemorial. New things are released, old ones sunsetted, replacements needed, the wheel keeps turning. Players can spend tens or hundreds of hours playing these games so it's hard to label them cash grabs.

As for Robux scams; Roblox do what they can. All of these take place off site so Roblox has no real authority over them, they can block phrases and make it harder but the real power over the scammer comes down to educating your children not to fall for them.",2021-01-06,1609914611.0

r/roblox,"I’m a dev. Roblox literally incentives Pay2Win games. Roblox does not care that much for the quality of the gaming hemisphere or the site itself too much. As long as they are pulling in millions of dollars, “who cares if games are preying on little kids, it’s making us rich.”

I can’t even put the blame all on Roblox because they don’t make the games. I’ve been a player since 2011. The community had its faults then as it does now but it just wasn’t this bad or heartless. Biggest reason is because of the developer exchange. As great as it is. Now it’s kinda trash because the rates aren’t good but yeah it makes people want to generate as much robux as they can on their game just to cash out. Honestly sadly this type of bull crap only works on children. And Roblox didn’t originally market towards children until obviously the saw the profit potential.

There are still many games that are made for fun and aren’t pay 2 win. But it gets harder and harder to find if you aren’t an og of roblox or deep in the dev community.

I have nothing against making robux with your products. But I’m with you, some developers are just ripping people off and it’s so lame.",2021-01-06,1609946163.0

r/roblox,yeah the way roblox (mainly games and devs) has completely collapsed into what it is today really disappoints me and probably many others,2021-01-06,1609927729.0
r/roblox,"This is common practice in the game industry (from a consumers perspective). And stuff does get changed code wise and visual wise. It's just how sequels usually are executed. 

The same happens with FIFA, a less obvious but similar thing happens with assassin's creed and even GTA. Mechanics get changed but the core mechanics remain the same conceptual wise. It's what it is and there's little to change about it.

As for background info as to how I kno this, I myself am a roblox developer (programmer specifically) and work as a freelancer for several years now and am currently majoring in Game Development as an education, you can check me out under the name VoidedBlades. 

I'd just like to point out that these ""cash grabs"" are nothing more but a kid liking something and wanting to spend money on it, could even compare it to a person's hobby where they'd spend thousands of dollars on it. or even continuously buying lego for a kid as they love to play with it. However hobbies will usually change with time.

I just find it simply rude to claim that they just take the same game and rename it. A lot of work goes into reworking a game for a sequel even though a consumer might not directly see it.

Last but not least, we also need to make money to live. Roblox is our source of income despite it being an instable soure as income fluctuates heavily for a lot of developers.

And before assumptions are made. I do not create these type of games (I have contact with those who do and have had an in depth look on the genre and execution) as they don't lie within my range of interest.",2021-01-06,1609924690.0

r/roblox,"As a game developer, I agree that these kinds of monetization systems are EXTREMELY toxic, downright RADIOACTIVE. These ""Simulator""-type games are specifically engineered to draw kids in and take their money, their greed tarnishing the very reputation of Roblox game development in general. 

The game dev community is kinda split into two types of developers: Those who actually MAKE good games and those who make cash grabs to take people's money. I call them ""Makers"" and ""Takers"" respectively.

The best advice I can give is to teach your child that there's no shame in playing the original game, as sequels tend to be bad anyways; and try to find some other games with actual gameplay value, so ""simulator""-type games become boring to him.",2021-01-06,1609946656.0
r/roblox,"As a Roblox game developer I totally agree. A lot of games have really overpriced stuff and that makes it bad, even cash grab or scam games are really bad too. In my game, the best gamepasses to buy are under 100 robux so that it’s accessible for one with 1 dollar. I really don’t care about the robux, I only care about players experience :)",2021-01-06,1609970044.0
r/roblox,"Just having quickly hopped into both games and having a look around, I'd certainly say that from a developer of other games on this site and consumers perspectives that this game isn't anywhere near as bad as you're making it out to be, its obvious that a lot of effort has gone into new assets, interfaces, effects, etc. while you could argue the map layout is the same, I'd easily argue ""well if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". they have a map layout that works and is intuitive to players that have played the previous game(s).  


moving onto the statements about it using all of the same gamepasses/purchases:  
the only things I can see that are similar in terms of monetization between the two (granted I've only looked at their store tab on the website) are the things like perks. 2x storage, 2x collection, that kind of thing. I don't really see anything wrong here, almost all games have them, they're entirely optional and are only there to help speed up progression.  


in summary:  
at the end of the day, its entirely up to the developer(s) of that game to choose if they want to create a sequel based off the work that they've put into it. maybe there's just more they wanted to add to the second game that they couldn't do with the first due to technical limitations, maybe they just simply needed more money as you said. the developers of this game are people too and they need to make a living in order to pay for rent, food, etc. just like everyone else. in my opinion, saying otherwise is well, putting it politely, rather disrespectful of you.",2021-01-06,1609930560.0

If you really want to let your kid have Robux without ripping a hole in your wallet, install Google Opinion Rewards. It's a first party app by Google that's actually trustable. You answer questions related to you and other stuff, and it gives you Google play credit that expires within a year. You can spend this on anything in the Google play shop, I ncluding Robux.

Basically every game is made by users, (As I'm sure you know,) and the userbase/developers would complain if their game was taken down for ""scams,"" as technically it's not a scam, but in essence, it basically is. My solution is to not play those games, I know the issue is that your child probably only plays those games ... and I don't know what to do about it. As for robux spending ... I've only spent it on catalog items, clothing or in the select games in play that I adore. MOST simulator games are filled with those annoying/not very useful gamepasses.  

Now for actual scams: People have tried to scam me tons of times for robux, mainly by PMs on ROBLOX. They claim to be a ""User reporter,"" or something. I've watched tons of videos on those, and no you scammers cannot have my limiteds.

But I would like to stress that not all studios are like this, There are good developers on the platform that bring interesting and unique things to ROBLOX, it is a shame that there are some bad apples that give the platform a bad rep That plus the limits of the ROBLOX engine its self, And the fact that ROBLOX gives us pretty crappy exchange rates. Which can be the reason ROBLOX games have so many microtransactions (Though I don't defend these actions And Defiantly am against pay 2 win.) Best way to find good ROBLOX games for you and your child is to avoid the front page games, They are often the more clickily microtransaction games of the platform. Instead I'd recommend searching online for some ROBLOX games that fit you and your Childs favoured genre, There are a lot of YouTube videos on good ROBLOX games.

r/roblox,"I agree with you 100%. As a Roblox player since 2008, I have seen the change of Roblox turning more into a cash grab platform. If you did not know, back in the early days of Roblox there used to be a 2nd Roblox currency known as Tix. Every player got 10 Tix every day as a daily log-in reward and could get more Tix by place visits in which you got 1 Tix for every visitor. The user could of spent Tix to buy items in the catalog and could trade Tix for Robux using the **RoblEX** trade system. Sadly in 2016 Roblox removed Tix making everything now require Robux, this the where the modern-day problem that you have stated comes into effect. Sadly the people who run Roblox seem to not care anymore since now they make more money from people buying Robux. The only way to see if Roblox really wants to change this is if a Tix like system returns, which will sadly most likely never happen again.",2021-01-06,1609944390.0

I'd recommend the kids to play games that are original and not that too popular since jn my experience the buy with robux pop up rarely appear to me. Avoid if not be cautious on tycoon or any other simulator shenanigans they have a cesspool of scam items that doesnt do much and might be not permanent. Teach the kids to be wary on clicking things fast without hesitation this might slwp their progression on the game they'd chosen but its the safest way.
Clothes:
Shirts and pants are repetitive and sometimes too cheap or too expensive which can scam in anyway matter. Cheaps can be deleted just like mine, they tend to sell it at 5 robux and adds an eyecatching name and design. Same with the expensive ones. In my opinion they should buy at a group ad and game clothes market or buy originals at the origin.
Accessories are okay
Gear never buy them at all
Limited they are just collectors item which they resell or something idk why.

Lastly make sure the children never go to free robux sites without their acc having a pin and a verified email. They might not take your password but they can take your IP and might use it to their advantage. Some may actually give them robux but still its better to be safe than sorry.

r/roblox,"All of this, just for robux. Dang.

The value of robux compare to the US dollar is continuing inflating every time someone buys robux. The only reason why it hasn't inflated to the point of it being post WWI Germany is this thing called tax, where roblox (the corporation) receives 30% of all robux transaction and whenever someone buys a item created by roblox with robux. The only way of obtaining robux legally is buying roblox premium because it offers more then buying regular robux, but the pricing is expensive enough where someone can't just buy over 100,000 robux without spending $1,000 usd (only reason why someone would do this is if they are investing in limited items but that's another topic) but too expensive where you not really getting your money worth if you don't buy premium.

Anyways, all games die at some point, and some game devs milk the same cow. Trying to make as much robux without much more work. And with 30% tax on purchases that affects games dev robux income, they add new stuff, maybe change visual, mostly small changes, called it ""insert game name 2"" create the game, and milk the same cow to make robux. and because its a new game, the gamepass are incompatible. So if a dev makes a net total of 140k robux off the game, that's because 30% of the gross income gets taxes, which in this example 60k robux. (They can also exchange robux to USD on a special rate and on a special program called DevEX, but thats another topic. Obviously they can only exchange their net robux income made from the game)

I have no clue if the game devs are greedy but its a economic reason of why these things happen. Its it a good reason? Most likely not. Buts its a reason as regards to economics of roblox.

If a game dev really want to make robux and have a stable income is to just update their one game instead of creating a copy of it, slap a number on it, and call it a day.",2021-01-06,1609960463.0

Granted, I did have Roblox Premium Benefits, but I didn't spend any money on the game.

Also, the second Ninja Legends is cleaner and more challenging + interactive for users. I personally like the game a lot, and a lot of effort was put into the game, because it would take most people years to even create the map, but there is a lot of detail put into this game. It is a little bit pay to win, but every game has that aspect, no matter the size of the P2W.

r/roblox,"Roblox is a lot like the gaming industry, AAA games can be made annually, with some shine, and a new number. Pretty all of the sports games that are out are sequels with no changes other than graphics, roster, and a new number. Not all AAA companies have bad, P2W releases, though. But, if you take a look at smaller companies making indie games, they put a lot of effort into their style, and unique gameplay.

On Roblox, simulators don’t need to put any effort into their updates, and they’ll be popular. I don’t know how much effort it takes in order to produce their types of updates, so I can’t really judge them. But, they can release the same thing they did last update but with some remodels, and a different theme.

If you play a smaller game, or a game that’s made by a good group, updates/releases might take longer to come out but they have more quality to them, and they don’t feel as lazy as the larger games.

My personal recommendation for games on Roblox include:

[Arsenal](https://www.roblox.com/games/286090429/Arsenal) \- Fast-paced FPS with its main game mode being ‘gun game’ where you get a new gun every kill.

[Loomian Legacy](https://www.roblox.com/games/306964494/Holiday-Event-Loomian-Legacy?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Pokémon like gameplay.

[Welcome to Bloxburg](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) (paid access) - Build a house and roleplay with others.

[Vehicle Simulator ](https://www.roblox.com/games/171391948/2021-Vehicle-Simulator?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Unlike other simulators, you actually use a vehicle to drive around, and simulate something.

[Robeats!](https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212/feat-fusq-RoBeats-MMO-Rhythm-Game?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Vertical Scrolling Rhythm game, best rhythm game on Roblox in my opinion.

[Bad Business](https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-2-12?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Good FPS with really good, and fast movement.

[Outlaster](https://www.roblox.com/games/5343994291/Outlaster?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) or [Eviction Notice](https://www.roblox.com/games/2577040780/Eviction-Notice-BETA) \- Identical styles of gameplay where you play mini games, and vote out people in your team at the end of rounds.

[Iron Man Simulator 2 ](https://www.roblox.com/games/6097258548/Iron-Man-Simulator-2-BETA?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Simple controls and gameplay where you can use Iron Man suits.

[Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/2021-Gift-Horrific-Housing?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Stand on plates (with various game modes) and try to survive the events.

[Black Magic II](https://www.roblox.com/games/969669348/Black-Magic-II-RANKED?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- The most unique fighting game on Roblox, game play is kind of like Street Fighter, or Dragon Ball FighterZ.

[Anime Battle Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/1458767429/HOLIDAY-Anime-Battle-Arena) \- Fight using anime characters, the gameplay is more simple compared to Black Magic II.

[SARB](https://www.roblox.com/games/5848360485/SARB) \- Super Smash Bros. like gameplay but it's in 3D.

[Doomspire Brickbattle](https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- A game from the older Roblox, but remastered to fit Roblox's new physics, and engine (I don't know if that's the right word for it).

[Tower Defense Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Tower defense gameplay like Kingdom Rush, and Bloons, where you try to protect a location by placing units.

[World of Magic](https://www.roblox.com/games/3272915504/World-of-Magic?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Open world game, with a magic combat system, and your actions affect the world.",2021-01-06,1609967665.0

Here’s the silver-lining, kids who got scammed got a taste of the real world; scams don’t just happen on Roblox or online. They will learn how to be skeptical and understand when something is too good to be true.

Honestly parents with this overprotective mindset is just hurting them in the long run. Kids need to learn how the Internet works, their own action have consequences and experience the world by themselves, if they fuck up they will learn through their mistakes. I definitely fell for scams, got trolled and bullied on the internet when I was younger. I’m in my early twenties now; I turned out fine.

Then I tarted checking the game passes that my son wanted. Not only are there the same ones from the first Ninja Legends, but they added new ones to scrape a little more money from our pockets....

The Roblox platform itself has become corrupted and something needs to be done about it. Once I have gathered enough information and testimonials I plan to take a crack at gaining ground on them. They will change for the better or the public will change it for them.,2021-01-06,1609969719.0
r/roblox,"They made a second game that is in all aspects the same as the first game. I rolled around it for a while. Most of the passes are the same. That you can't fool me on. The area layout is 100% the same, the bosses has a new paint job and as for the interface. How does that make my kids or myself re buy game passes. I don't care how many upset developers come here cringing and thinking ""Better say something to defend this type of behavior"" is wrong. Again, what makes it worse is they mostly target children with this. I have also confirmed a few minutes ago that the developers are indeed paying YouTubers to advertise this clone. This is 100% a scheme to make more money, but their making A LOT more then an average person, so rent food and what not is not the problem.

It astonishes me that people see nothing wrong with this. You can't take old things, toss a number 2 on it and brand it a sequel. Would you watch a movie that had the same scenes, from the same actors, acting out the same things they did from the first movie? Lets take the movie Star Wars for example? Would you watch the death start being destroyed twice by the same weapons, by the same people? Would that make any sense? Or how about if a video game you often played copy and paste EVERYTHING from their first game and sold it to you as a new game? Would you pay for and play the same thing twice?",2021-01-06,1609924194.0

Take for example the YouTubers being payed to falsely tell children how great and amazing the game is, how they buy the passes on stream or video showing them how powerful it makes their character.

Scamming would be an illegal act of swindling someone out of their money for nothing (of equal value in return) or not getting what's stated when bought, which in this case they are getting. If not it's a violation of roblox's ToU. The value here is determined by the creator and stated when bought so the upper hand lies with them.

I have yet to make an informative post about scamming matters in terms of how they work as I've previously have given an in depth informative post on the devforums about cookie logging and several commonly executed scam attempts attached to it and how to prevent it from happening to yourself.

Don't get me wrong. A reupload of a previously created game (if they own the intellectual property) is morally wrong but legally not, if it would be companies like EA would be in major trouble with their 3rd reupload of the exact same game.

As I said previously, this is not ""in all aspects the same"" their new game has new (and not to mention higher quality) models, effects, artwork, animations, etc. just because the layout of the map is the same, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with it, it means that was the one aspect of the game they decided to bring over in order to make things intuitive to returning players. its not a criminal offense.

TIX was removed because when it was a thing, new players automatically got a certain amount of TIX (I don't know how much since it's been so many years but I'm guessing 20). You can also exchange a certain amount of TIX for exactly 1 Robux (again it's been years, so I don't know how much but I think you needed 100 TIX). So, the smart kids and adults used this to their advantage and spammed accounts and bought things that their main account made, which would usually be a shitty T-Shirt that costed TIX. The main account would get tons of TIX to exchange for Robux and the alt accounts would be left in the darkness. So, ROBLOX didn't remove it just because it wasn't making them money; they were actually losing money and the economy was being ruined.

You've talked about the real world in some of your other comments. Why not kill two birds with one stone and teach him how to deal with scams, peer pressure and the like using Roblox? It's a valuable life skill. That's all I'm saying.

I was once a child. I know what it's like with this kind of stuff, and I'm glad my parents taught me how to deal with stuff like this. (Not saying you are a bad parent.)

I'm not defending these practices, I just think this rant of yours is sort of useless because nothings going to change for two reasons: A), Roblox won't care, and B) The games aren't explicity breaking any rules. They shouldn't be taken down for ""scamming"" because they technically aren't and that would lead to bad precedent for the rest of roblox's games. Kind of like a vague rule which could technically be used to take down any game roblox admins dont' want around. That example is a exaggeration but I hope you get what I mean.

Again, no one is being forced to do stuff here. Manipulation != forced, and that's why I think these games shouldn't be taken down. As addicting a game is, as manipulative a youtuber is, at the end of the line, you're choosing to spend that money, that robux, and your time. You have to learn how to control it and think through it. Hard stuff to teach to a kid, I know, but now's a good time as any to start. (Besides... can't you just outright deny him the robux?

So all the content, specifically cosmetics, are earnable. Most are locked either way, behind methods of finding them/earning them, but the ones you can purchase are bought through what we call Hypercoin.

The Hypercoin is earnable, found through lucky spawns, completing contracts, drops from bosses or even enemies, and daily rewards.

r/roblox,"I understand your concern and of other parents within this thread. Sadly that snowballing has already been happening for years within that genre as it's to keep generating profit, there's no benefit in doing this on roblox's end as they'll lose valuable profit (their value has already been falling) nor is there anything legally that I can think of that'll make this happen.

This is something that seems uncontrollable from a consumer's perspective other than disallowing their children to spend Robux on the games that do that. 

Regardless, striving for such a change isn't bad whatsoever. It just seems out of reach in my eyes, which leaves the responsibility at the parents/guardians.

We're talking about a platform on the internet that has a main focus on having content generated for money after all. The internet is a scary place and can cause a lot of damage in a small time if treated without caution. That caution is usually one's own responsibility or of their parents/guardians.

One thing I do know is that this has only happened so far in the Roblox simulator genre (correct me if you've seen games in other genres do this) which is a current trend but should soon or later die out, just like any other trend on roblox, due to how it has been milked.",2021-01-06,1609946759.0

r/roblox,"Please, stop with the assumptions. I read your edit up in the post (not the comments) and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a Roblox shill or a 7 year old kid. That really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you, as you're opinion's already been made. 

I'm not sure if you know this, but Roblox does not make the games. All of Roblox's content is completely player made. (Well, with the exception of some events and tutorial games. Heck, the whole point of Roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games.) What does this mean?

Any multiplayer game has the danger of Adults and susceptible children meeting. It's not a new thing. Usually, the multiplayer game has safeguards, such as safe chat, child friendly mode, or whatever. But in the end, it's ultimately up to YOU to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online. The game can only do so much.

It's almost the same in Roblox's case. These are multiplayer interactions between players to players. People playing other player's games. Not player to company. You see, that's the huge difference. They can't be held accountable in the same ways. 

I hope you understand that I'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason, not because I only read a few sentences of your comments. The solution is with YOU guys, not the other way around. 

Look, I understand that these practices are quite shitty. But there's a real difference between actual scams and these ""scams"". I've seen games get taken down for real scams. For instance, you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t-shirt. That's a real, bonifide scam. Meanwhile, with your case, you're getting what you pay for. Sure, the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated. But the gamepass never promised how long the game would last, did it? Scummy, but legal. These practices are NOT criminal, despite how close they may seem. Taking action against things like these leave a HUGE precedent and could be damaging for all of Roblox. 

Let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of. Where does the solution lie? That's right, with YOU. Your son is choosing to play these games, and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform. He is choosing to play these scammy games, despite there being tons of other games out there. Issues that are out of his control, like nudity, swearing, etc, that is the type of stuff Roblox is trying to prevent. 

""Children should NEVER EVER be taken advantage of by adults."" I agree, but its the goddamn INTERNET. It never ever will be safe. Like, c'mon. If your child can't handle Roblox, maybe it's not the company's fault. It's not Roblox's job on how to teach your kid 21st century skills. They do what they can, but when it comes to issues born out of free-will, what the hell are they supposed to do? Your kid WANTS to buy this stuff, and if it's due to manipulation and targeting, then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit. As long as free speech exists, manipulation will too. Connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities. You know that.

If you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff, then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing Roblox. If you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids, then good for you. You're making the choices here.

I wish there was some sort of way to counteract scamming more than just them saying to be careful. My daughter and I have played for years, her more than me. And for the first time, she got scammed, bad. Her whole entire pet collection in Adopt Me. My hands went to my face the moment she mentioned her whole pet collection for 100k diamonds in Royale High. I gotta say tho, the scammer went as far as meeting up in royale high and starting trade, putting the 100k diamonds in, then waiting till the last second to bail. Said it was getting late and theyd do it again in the morning. They met her in the morning and tried again then promised after school. Well, they unfriended her. And her heart broke and I felt so bad for her. Me personally, I wouldn't bite if someone offers me all them diamonds for my entire pet collection. But she did it. And even though I have their username and account name I feel it's so pointless to try anything. And I mean really what is there. Reporting won't get her stuff back either.

r/roblox,"Adopt Me is the worst aspects of modern gaming
I've been watching my 10 year old niece play Roblox for a few months. Last week I decided to install it and play it with her to figure out exactly what it is all about.

Wow, this is worse than what people complain about EA/Activision games, and I don't understand why people aren't calling this child exploitation or raising pitch forks.

Grinding -> You spend your entire time micromanaging your pet (and/or baby) so you can earn currency to buy things. There's a constant list of things to buy (bigger houses, vehicles, eggs, etc). Want a neon pet? You have to grind 4 of the same pets and combine them. It's a big grind fest and the primary thing people trade ingame are pets for other pets & vehicles.

Loot Crates -> Eggs, Gift Boxes, etc. that have a posted % chance of getting rare items. Everyone wants Legendary items which have a 2-8% chance on most things. Have fun grinding for an hour or two only to get a common pet.

Micro Transactions -> Want a permanent pet fly/ride potion, rare pets, more faces, better houses, cars, wings, etc? Bust out your wallet. You're constantly spammed with things to buy as soon as you log on.

Prices -> Things are deliberately priced so that you have to buy more currency than you require. Example: a pet might cost 1000 robux, but you can only buy 800 ($9.99) or 1700 ($19.99) robux at a time.

Pay 2 Win -> Want to skip the grind? Bust out your wallet and dump $40-100 to get everything you need.",2020-07-16,1594917102.0

r/roblox,"While I completely agree with most of the points you made, it's not the smartest to compare this to EA or Activision games. EA is one of the largest game distributors there is. I hate how much microtransactions they put in their games, because they are making tons of money from sales of the games, advertising, events that promote the games all around the world.

Roblox developers earn money via DevEx, which means they exchange the robux made from their game, to real money. Sadly, only way to do this, is put bunch of shit kids will want to buy in your games, so if you want to make living from being a ROBLOX developer, this is the only way. You can also make your game pay to enter, but those dont get as much traffic. There's only two games that have made some headlines while being paid (eventho it's like 20 cents to enter) - Apocalypse Rising 2 and Welcome To Bloxburg.

Adopt Me is free to enter, like 99% of the games made on Roblox. The only way for the developers to earn cash, is by microtransactions and gamepasses. While I completely disagree with exploiting children with all these pets and passes, it's nowhere different from other games, where there is lootcrates etc.

The game itself is trash, all these houses, cars and pets are what make the most of the game community, and the online daters aswell ofcourse.",2020-07-16,1594943727.0

A fake trade request pops up and then pictures of high-tier pets will appear. The victim will then ""accept"" the trade, and a second pop up will prompt the victim to enter their username and password to ""verify"" something.

Anyways, after the victim puts in their password the standard scam stuff happens, all of the Robux on the account gets drained, and then the account is used to make more scam games to steal more passwords and more Robux, sort of like a pyramid scheme.

r/roblox,-this guy (3 hours ago:here(hasn't moved)),2020-07-17,1594955320.0
r/roblox,"Personally, in my opinion, DevEX is what actually made Roblox worse (for me). Here are some of my thoughts:

* DevEX could be the root cause of clothing spam bots. Before DevEX, Robux was just an in-game only token with no real world value. Now that Robux is worth real money with DevEX, people have more motivation than ever to exploit the flawed system. Talented people have spent time making these bots and fight to keep them running. There wouldn't be real life benefit to clothes botting if Robux didn't have real value.
* While DevEX can reward great developers, it does motivate some devs into optimizing their game for maximum profit, sometimes by using bad monetization tactics like those that OP mentioned. Games are more likely to be more of the same, with big colorful ""Shop"" button as if Shop is the #1 button players want to interact the most with. Or a timer pressuring me to buy the limited time Starter Pack when I first played a game before I even know if the game is going to be enjoyable for me or if the pack is really a good value.
* While DevEX let people do things they enjoy, it could also attract profit-driven tycoons who only cares about profit who make game just because money.
* Before DevEX, one-person made games at least have some chance of getting to the Front Pages. Now that there are professional teams and studios that are formed to make everything more efficient, one-person games have practically a little chance; No longer that side projects made just for fun can get popular, ""Use money to make money"" now apply even if you don't intend to earn money.
* Optimizing to appeal to the most player as possible can result in monoculture in the long term. Games can become more bland and/or more of the same overtime.

Look at the DevHunt 2019 and 2020 (some could argue even 2015); so many participating games are absolutely optimized to the max for maximum profits and play-time without considering players' enjoyment while also putting in as little effort and creativity it as possible. Some even used psychological tricks to get you to buy things. (Roblox could do better in quality control, but I think if DevEX isn't here these DevHunts could be at least a bit more bearable)

Now, I understand that there's no going back now as much as I want them to. People have already made Roblox Development their main job, and I absolutely do not want to ruin anyone's living on this planet Earth. Changes of the DevEX kind is simply irreversible, and I understand it. I'm not protesting for DevEX to be removed, I just want to express my thoughts.

This is just my opinion, I can be wrong, but things like this have at least for me, ruined YouTube in the recent years; now that people have taken YouTube as a job.  Many have to obey ""the Algorithm"" just to make a rent.  Many censor themselves because they don't want to risk being demonetized.  Videos that should be shorter are stretched to \~10 min. for maximum ad revenue.  Clickbait are used to lure in the most views.  Some creators sacrifice quality just to pump out new videos every day.  Then there are tycoons churning out inappropriate and uncreative cartoons because they're lured in by money.  Some now even openly admits to using clickbait after being called out, but ultimately shrugged it as ""It's just business"".  Yes, Roblox and YouTube is not the same, but DevEX have already made an impact, for better or for worse. It seems everything is all about money now, and I mean only and purely about money.

And yes, this monetization schemes did bring more production value to both Roblox games and YouTube videos, but I find that it's getting harder to find enjoyable Roblox games or YouTube videos that respect my time after these schemes take place. For me, production value doesn't always mean it's going to be enjoyable.

I'm also very sorry for the long reply. These are just my opinion.",2020-07-17,1595009315.0

I can still remember days where you could get daily free Tix currency for just logging in to the site.

That free currency was removed not long after Roblox went mainstream and new leadership take place.

Games on Roblox back then also don't have flashy color, big ""Shop"" button and terrible monetization tactics, because you can't exchange Robux for real money like you can now (which led to the terrible profit-first design like you see in Adopt Me).

""Guest"" feature was intended for parents to try out Roblox before they allow their child to play it without giving information and create a Roblox account. That was also removed from Roblox after new leadership take place.

I have two sons who I let play Roblox occasionally.  They are 10, and 7, and probably a little too trusting of friends.

We have since had a discussion about putting information out over the internet and sharing passwords, but their accounts are still in control of whoever this other person is.

r/roblox,"It's unfortunate to hear that your sons were tricked but I suppose it's better for them to learn this lesson now than later. In regards to your question, [I recommend contacting the roblox customer service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313390-My-Account-was-Hacked-What-do-I-do-) if you are unable to recover via email. It's important to note though that ~~if~~ the customer service representative working with you approves your sons' accounts for a restoration (such as if items/robux were taken out of the accounts), they will only do so once for an account; this means that if either of your sons' accounts are compromised in the future, regardless of losing a significant amount more or less of items/robux, they will be ineligible for an item/robux restoration (they will however be eligible for assistance in retrieving a compromised account). Likewise, customer support has a 14-day limit on item/currency restorations. Although the link doesn't explicitly mention this, users on this subreddit have reported past successes in recovering accounts if they made purchases on them - with this in mind, I recommend keeping your payment information on standby but not providing anything unless asked. I hope that this helps!

r/roblox,"Roblox games on Xbox can use A button to scam players out of robux
Twice recently my daughter lost Robux unexpectedly playing a game on the Xbox version. After doing some research, it appears to be down to specifically how the Xbox version of Roblox maps controller buttons. By default, I believe the A button is mapped to Jump & Confirm. So when a dialog pops up, e.g. Purchase this in game item, the A button is used to confirm the purchase.

When a game (like an Obby) makes a lot of use of Jump and also includes in-game purchases, this creates a situation where accidental purchases are super easy. So easy that while my daughter was carefully trying to show me what happened, without triggering the purchases, she accidentally triggered the purchase.

I've reached out to Roblox customer support about this and so far they've been extremely unhelpful. Their position is summarised as:

* They can't (or won't) refund robux
* Issues in games are the developers responsibility
* Developers can't refund robux
* Tell the developer because we're sure they'd want to fix it

I don't believe this is a developer issue though if the default for games on Xbox has the A button mapped to two operations. Maybe a developer could remap, I don't know as I'm not a Roblox dev, but regardless, this is very much a Roblox issue and one they should address (and refund on).

[https://twitter.com/wideawakewesley/status/1348700550142054400](https://twitter.com/wideawakewesley/status/1348700550142054400)

Here's another great example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQyMcVH8LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQyMcVH8LM)

r/roblox,"Interesting.  Roblox could fix this by adding a second confirmation on Xbox in which ""A"" defaults to cancel, or by having a one to two second wait period before you confirm.  That being said, a developer could address this by not giving you a purchase prompt while you are in a situation in which you would normally be jumping. 

 In a situation like you described, the developer probably has not thought about that being an issue, since you would not have the same problem on PC.  

The scary thing about this, is that it could be used to scam Xbox players.  Maybe if you mentioned your concerns regarding that to Roblox, they may implement some kind of confirmation.",2021-01-14,1610645684.0

Forgive me if I don't get alll the terminology correct here as I don't play the game.

My 11 year old daughter has been playing  roblox for quite a while and from what I can tell has built herself up a decent account. Recently someone scammed her somehow by stealing some sort of legendary rideable flyable neon dragon and some various other animals she had collected . She was devastated. We talked about password safety and scammers. Today she came Out bawling saying someone scammed her during something called a trust trade?

This person promised her a bunch of stuff for her rideable dragon but from what I gather, the person took the dragon and left the server.

Is there anything I can do to help her get this stuff back? I emailed roblox a while back about the first incident and they couldn't garuntee her stuff being reinstated and it doesn't look like its going to be.

r/roblox,"Oh... I'm sorry for you're daughter and her lost things. I assume that the game is the certain: Adopt Me! game? I don't think there is anyway to get her stuff back but some tips for you're daughter:

Never Trust anyone that you don't know in real life.

Don't do trust trades! 99% of the time it's a scam.

Don't give out a password to someone when they guarantee free stuff.

Don't buy other perks from other games telling they'll guarantee you that item in another game.

Trade stuff that are the same value.

Whenever trading, write down the user's name so if they leave, you can report them to the owner of the game or Roblox Support.

The past three days (July 2nd, July 3rd, and July 4th) we have been out of town with no access to her account. When we got back she immediately hoped on her account only to go into full meltdown, after an hour of calming her down, I discovered the issue.

The 275 robux she's had when left had dissappeared, replaced by a Pepino mouse shirt now worth 185 robux, purchased July 3rd when she had no access to her account, nor did anyone else.

How could this have happened? She is terrified she has been hacked, but why would a hacker just purchase a shirt?

When I didn't find a refund button and did some googling, I realised the chances of her getting refunded were unlikely, so I offered to buy her robux to replace the lost ones, but she insists it's pointless to have robux if her account is hacked.

Thanks to a YouTuber (I forget which, maybe itsfunneh?) she knows how to avoid the common scams and has even instructed me on how to as well. 

Any help with what could have happened and how I can reassure her her account is sfae now that I've changed the password?

I'm also confused how the hacker could of gotten her password? I am the only one who knows it, I didn't tell her.",2018-07-06,1530843768.0
r/roblox,"Hi - welcome to the sub.

There's a few possibilities, but here's a guess.

1. Her account password was weak and it got guessed.

2. She downloaded something that 'keylogged' her password.

3. Possibly she knew the password and accidentally fell for a phishing scam?(This is unlikely by what you stated, but I'm leaving this as a possibility.)

___

First of all, I highly recommend you to set up security settings on her account.


**Enable Two Factor Authentication** - https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-2-Step-Verification-Information 

**PIN** - Through [settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/security), you can enable a separate PIN inside of your account settings to prevent unwanted changes to your account settings.

**More secure password** - Secure passwords are difficult to guess, have long lengths with mixes of capital letters and uncommon keys(e.g @#$%^*&). You can also use a [password manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/877c10/looking_for_password_manager_recommendations/) to handle your passwords for both your Roblox account and other sites.

**Never give away your account details.** - There is almost no situation where you can reasonably give away your account details. Roblox staff will never need access to your account. Always check frequently when clicking links whether you are on the official Roblox website(www.roblox.com) before entering any account details.

**Beware of off-site downloads** - Off site downloads can contain malicious content which steals your account details. Be wary when downloading anything from untrusted sources, especially sketchy forums promising 'free' or 'paid' cheats/hacks for games. This includes browser extensions.

___

Aside from that, Roblox has a ton of security options that should prevent this in the future. Above are the examples(2FA, PIN, etc) which would make it much easier. There's also an option on the settings to log out anyone that isn't your device/computer in the settings panel.

You can also contact roblox support for help -  https://roblox.com/support

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. We get a lot of parents on the sub who are confused on what to do, and most of us are happy to help.

r/roblox,"Enable two-step verification in settings, there is nothing else you can do but thankfully that should be enough.",2018-07-06,1530844293.0
r/roblox,"It's very likely that you have a keylogger on your computer. Uninstall suspicious software, if you have to run virus scans (dont download virus scanning software though) use windows defender. Then change the password and enable two step verification. This will force you to have to enter a text code that's sent to you by email every time your child logs in, or every thirty days depending on which setting you pick. Once you've updated all account info report the owner of the shirt on site and email roblox support including that users username. Once the message is sent to support it may take around 12 hours to get feedback however it's very likely that your child will get the robux back. If you want, I'm totally down to give you triple the amount your daughter lost, tell her to not worry and that everything will likely be restored soon!!!",2018-07-06,1530869510.0
r/roblox,"Oops.

Password was weak?

(Let's say your daughter's name is Elaine, then it would be ""elaine2006"" if she was born in 2006, or something along those lines.))

Anyways, were any relatives home? She could've told the pass to a family member, and perhaps they played a cruel joke.",2018-07-06,1530870947.0
r/roblox,"My guess was she fell to a robux scam (they ask you for your password saying that they will give you robux abd then they steal your money) and the reason a hacker would buy a shirt through a hacked account is probably because the shirt is actually made by the hacker and when you buy it the money goes to them so you can try reporting the creator of the shirt A.K.A the hacker

Hope it helps",2018-07-07,1530928831.0
r/roblox,"Hello there,

Something like this has happened to me before.

On the 4th of July, 2018, my Roblox account was hacked by someone unknown. They purchased Robux on my account (I knew that because when I checked my Robux, the balance was up to 123 to 943). Later on, I accessed Roblox again and saw that my account was deleted for unauthorized/disputed charges. I emailed Roblox Support as quick as possible. Some hours later, I received a reply saying that my appeal has been sent to a billing specialist who will be able to assist me further.

After 6 days of waiting, I finally received a reply from a billing specialist saying that my appeal has been denied. When I read the message, I was completely clueless since ”one or more of the purchases made to this account were reported as disputed/unauthorized by the card owner through Google Play.“ 

I had absolutely no idea what that meant since the card holder is clearly me. What I assumed happened is that the hacker purchased Robux on my account with a different card so Roblox saw the charges is unauthorized and terminated my account. 

The question is... How did they assume such a strong password? The hacker could have possibly keylogged my Roblox account. After some weeks later, I finally received another message from Roblox saying that my account has been unbanned. Later on, I activated 2 step verificafion so something like this won’t happen again.

I also forgot to mention that the hacker left a message on my account. ”This is what you get.“",2018-08-16,1534411354.0
r/roblox,"Why pet simulator x is really not a good game.
The game is really a bad game due to the fact that it constantly pushes microtransactions onto the player and it's literally pay to win. want to know how it forces microtransactions? it forces them for example there is a way to get some things without paying, but you have to go through hell and back just to get these things for free. for example free pet slots. for example op pets. with the merchant update, it makes it worse because you have no choice but to spend your Robux on diamonds because it's not really like you can get 14 m just by grinding in the game. it really evident they just want your money because of ven the smallest things like the boosts costing Robux, and the dark matter pet queue. Now, want to know how its pay to win? it is pay to win because of the fact that the game is not enjoyable and someone wouldn't willingly spend money on it because the game is basically ""you don't wanna spend money? okay, then you'll have to work through hell to earn it."" and because being a new player makes it really hard to play the game for free because if takes you at least a few weeks to get ""op pets"" while if you spent money on the game, you would gt there in little to no time. not to mention that the dev of the game Involved nfts in a children's game/game that targets kids. this shows how hungry for money he is. and he sold those stupid plushies unlicensed as well and they are a terrible way of receiving codes as it is very easy for someone to buy these and literally cut the code off of the plush or already use it and then they sell it to someone not knowing that that person used the code.

r/roblox,"You are wrong. Pet Simulator X is an AFK grinding game. You don't have to spend money, though it does speed things up. What you have to do is download a free program called OP Autoclicker (for windows) . This allows you to grind the Giant Alien Chest 24hours per day if you want. And this is how you advance in Pet Simulator X. If you enjoy the game and you spend money it will speed you up but the pets that you can buy for Robux are way worse than the free pets that you hatch in the game. 

I can see how if you aren't very smart, you are very young, or just don't understand the concept of AFK grinding you may think that this game is Pay to Win. I will admit that there are some things that you can pay for to speed things up but it isn't necessary to have a good experience.",2021-12-21,1640112017.0

I've never spent robux on pet sim x and I only have to unlock 1 area before I have unlocked every area in the game (I've basically finished the game). ""if you don't want to spend money, well then your going to have to work through hell to earn it"", excuse me but that is the point of the game isn't it? to work? yes it may be hard but if they just let you breeze through all the stages and pets nobody would play it because there would be no challenge. the merchant is there so you can spend those diamonds if you have them, it's not *forcing* you too do anything. ""a big scam"". a big scam? really? a scam is when you are lured into spending robux on something that isn't worth it. the things you can spend robux on are all somewhat worth it, and it isn't requiring you to make a purchase if you don't want to. if you don't like the game, or you don't want to spend robux on it, don't play it? don't spend robux on it? it's really not that hard just to leave it alone, as some people like me really enjoy the game.

As a pet sim X player, I am not mad at this but I dont agree Because I have played it for 4 months, I didn't even spend a dollar on it but still can play normally.

Because you need to pay for huge cats and huge stuff? Then huge pumpkin cat, You can't even buy it. So it isn't that bad. I played and I know how it's like. You don't need to buy to get a scam tho? Preston tried hard to create a game for people who like pet simulators. They tried to be better and made the huge cat plushie to earn some more money.

r/roblox,i wanted to edit this post because of the most recent news around pet sim x which was the changeof price in the egg. it was 800 ribux previously ut then it was changed to 1200,2021-12-29,1640736583.0
r/roblox,"yeah, but at least they didnt violate tos sm",2022-01-10,1641839519.0
r/roblox,"it still is. the game takes advantage of kids epically when the Christmas egg was released he changed the price to 1200 when he could have left it at 800. and to even get through the game quickly you have to spend money. a free to play a player who doesn't buy anything to grind for pets would keep struggling to get ""op"" pets after every update, but a p2w player would have gotten through the whole game within a day. the game forces you to go through so much to get one pet slot, and then as you keep unlocking them becomes hard to obtain certain pets like ones that cost Robux, and the plushies as well. another problem was the release of the in-game merchant that would sell pets at extremely expensive prices and the banks as well. when the game first came out you were forced to walk back and forth if you didn't wanna buy the tp thing but that got changed. then the merchant update. people were upset about it because of how expensive the pets would be and not everyone is able to get diamonds quickly. the banks' update is extremely horrendous. i had grinded to get to 7mil to buy it and then when I did buy it, after looking around, the next teir is  FOURTY MILLION diamonds. that was terrible pricing as people cannot afford that much and some people ant even auto farm for that much, and a lot of people such as myself either had 1 mil or just had nothing left after buying the bank. another big problem with the game is how Preston fails to show people what his game really does contain. so many people were disappointed at either the game itself or at least one of the updates because they always got overhyped. another problem is that kids were legit wasting Robux on this game by buying things become ALOT of the children's  side cant afford Robux like that or arent allowed to get it alot either",2022-01-12,1642016015.0

lol, and it kinda seems like you are angry but I'm speaking the truth abt the game. its as bad as Preston's other pet sims. they were all cash-grabs. also remember his audience the game caters to is mostly of kids who have no idea what they could be doing. you should let people have their own opinions on the game. he's just as bad as his own game is. he was so down bad for money he involved nfts in the game. a Roblox game that caters to children",2021-12-03,1638571888.0

Not at the expense of other developers. There are a lot of reasons to open 3rd party store even in a non NFT way but no one did it as they know it would a big no no for Roblox and likely stricting up the enforcement. Similar things happen for Epic Games vs Apple, I don't get why people think it is smart and ""forward thinking"" to  bypass limitation given the lawsuit.

>Why you think players would want to inform themselves on behind the scene mechanics idk.

>Roblox rules are created to not disrupt community experiences. 

Parents behind players would be freaked out if they see NFT up to $1000 without understanding anything.  They would make unreasonable demand disregard to the community.

> If the developers ever get in trouble though

Yes, by releasing NFT for a big game when majority of community didn't understand it. Developers did patron in low profile for same reason. Now developers are scared since roblox said they enforce it more due to NFT incident.  

> Stop informing yourself by reading intetnet trolls and posts and actually look up what blockchain is.

As I haven’t actually seen the NFT yet, i wouldnt know how its valued currently, but not every NFT is going to sell for more than $100. NFT doesn’t mean expensive.

Roblox, Apple or any private entity would still enforce the rules even you sell it as NFT. Changing payment method to cryto -> NFT has the same implication as changing payment method to your own (which happened for Apple vs Epic), you could still get rule enforced on you. They enforce on creators which Blockchain doesn't protect on. 

> As I haven’t actually seen the NFT yet, i wouldnt know how its valued currently, but not every NFT is going to sell for more than $100. NFT doesn’t mean expensive. 

They're now for gaming items as people speculative investing on NFT for metaverse things. The NFT pet in pet simulator costed 19000 USD at one point. Gaming items could high price hold true even it is even not NFT, looks at Pet simulator plushies. NFT pushes it to very unreasonable price.

> Stop fearing the unknown and creating scenarios in your head that haven’t happened. 

I think developers feared creating 3rd party store very openly would make roblox stricted up enforcing was true.

> NFTs is just a new way to sell/buy virtual content with lower fees. A marketplace. 

It is true and I already know, but not relevant when the roblox could just ban you off platform so the item hold no value when the game (thus ""assets"" themselves) doesn't exist, unless pretrson makes pet simulator standalone.

r/roblox,"Story about why you shouldn't let your kids create anything in Roblox Studio
What follows is a moderation story. I am pretty sure appeals is never going to get back to us with anything useful so I mainly want to share this so others don't end up in a similar situation.

At first I was just planning on posting up the very frustrating appeals emails with Roblox support but I am not sure it would be helpful. It seems it is well known that the appeals system is broken and not in place to assist users. Instead I am just going to post up about what led to my kids account being banned. Hopefully this can serve to prevent other young peeps from having a similar situation happen to them.

My 7 year old has been playing Roblox for a number of years and absolutely loves it, we enjoy the freedom she has by being able to play a huge number of game types in one place and she even recently started to try her shot at making her own games. She watched a Youtuber create a clone of Adopt Me and wanted to try it herself (danger zone). At the time I was unaware that this was against the ToS as there are innumerable such games all over Roblox. I imagined it would be a good way to get a feel for game creation and provide further ideas for how she might want to create her own games.

She found some resources in Roblox Studio from Adopt Me (danger zone 2) and whipped out a quick game. At the time I thought nothing of it, after all if what she was doing was a problem why would there be so many games that looked just like the popular ones.

A couple days after publishing her game she goes to her computer and it says her account has been banned. Specifically for ""creating a phishing game designed to scam other players"". I can assure you she has no idea what phishing is (now she does because I had to define it for her, so I guess the learning is a silver lining), she only knows what scamming is in terms of what she should look for when someone is trying to get her to do something wrong.

She was devastated. Not only was her account banned, but for a reason she didn't even understand. She does extra chores for Robux and invests real time and effort into the platform. Now she is not sure if she ever wants to put in the same effort again, and I don't blame her. After being hit with a capricious ban she doesn't even want to open Roblox Studio for the fear that what she might do could get her new account banned. Every time she goes to play an old favorite she has that halting realization that all the time she put into it was wasted and the Robux she used to get VIP is completely gone. She tries to pretend like it's not a big deal but each time she tries something she used to do she gets real quiet and sad.

I tried to get more information from the appeals system as to exactly what she did that was considered phishing or scamming. At best by looking here and in the DevForums I believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it, without official confirmation this is complete conjecture. Appeals was unwilling to give me any actual useful information and has ghosted us on responses after the first few that were obvious form letters. I mainly don't understand how it moved to immediate ban and kangaroo court appeals. There is no room to grow or understand.

I am greatly disappointed in Roblox, a platform I had previously recommended heavily to friends and their kids, but it has let us down immensely. This disappointment is compounded even further by not having any useful, official channel to resolve grievances. Literally the only thing I can do is post here on Reddit, which is, at best, just so I can say to my daughter that I tried everything I could think of. Maybe I'll wait for the IPO, buy a share and go complain at an investors meeting. I sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else as it was a fairly traumatic (to a 7 year old).

TL;DR Be very careful about letting your kids use Roblox Studio as it may lead to bans for offenses they do not understand and you will not receive justification for. Also be careful what you let you kids copy from Youtube.

GIANT IMPORTANT FOLLOW UP:  After all the super useful information here I put in one last hail mary email to appeals about the free models containing malicious code and how it was unfair to expect a child to understand those dangers.  Just got a response from appeals and they changed her ban to a warning, which I honestly did not expect at all.  For anyone else in a similar situation I highly recommend persevering while also being unfailingly polite.  While the end result is a win I still feel Roblox needs to improve their customer service.  I am just glad that at least some of my faith in Roblox as an entity has been restored.",2021-01-29,1611923788.0
r/roblox,"Yeah, it sucks but Roblox be Roblox. It's support is garbage and the playerbase has already known it for years.

&#x200B;

One thing I'll explain though :

\> I believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it, without official confirmation this is complete conjecture

You're right but kind of not, people like to add scripts into free models in the Toolbox section of the program that do stuff like pop up a store item that's worth X amount of Robux which will be stolen, redirect you to a phishing game or something similar which may steal accounts, passwords or Robux. It's not a backdoor, it's a script that's designed to do a malicious thing.

There's a reason the Roblox community says to never use the Toolbox because of this, but I understand that your kid is a kid, so according to them it was innocent fun. The Roblox Studio program is truly a great and creative thing and you should let her use it, but warn her that she shouldn't use player-made models in risk that the account may be marked as phishing/scamming and terminated.",2021-01-29,1611925665.0
r/roblox,"You could help her by giving her tutorials on how to model, script, ect. You can make some great things just NEVER use the toolbox as half the items in there, if put in your game, will get you banned almost instantly. There are some tutorials on how to clean models and get the malicious scripts out IF you want to use the toolbox.",2021-01-29,1611929428.0
r/roblox,"Something like this can be really discouraging.  Hopefully your daughter doesn't give up - that's the worst thing that can happen.

If she found resources that actually belonged to another game, and if she designed the game to be a clone of another game, that may be why she got the ban.  Especially if she ever got around to adding in purchases.  If I remember correctly, Roblox has sometimes had an issue with people ripping popular games, and then trying to get people to make purchases on their game rather than the actual one.  This would count as a scam, since people would buy the item on the fake game, expecting that they were getting it for the real game (seems like I read about this somewhere, sadly I can't seem to find a link to it at this time).  Unfortunately, I'm not the Roblox appeals team, and I can't tell you why they did what they did, or why you did not get an adequate response.

In all likelihood, somebody probably reported the game.  This could explain why Roblox gave your daughter's game specific attention rather than some other clone.  From their perspective, somebody just said that a game tried to scam them, and while looking at it they realize that it looks like a clone of a popular game.

I would like to just mention (and you probably already know this) that as long as you're following the ToS (make sure everything is your IP, no bad content) you shouldn't have to worry about a ban.  That doesn't rule out the chance of moderators making a horrible mistake, but it is unlikely.

All I can really say though, is that I'm sorry that this happened to your daughter.  But most of all, don't let one bad experience cause you to give up!

r/roblox,"there is nothing wrong with kids using studio, but she might have added free models that contain malicious scripts.",2021-01-29,1611964598.0
r/roblox,Oof. I feel for you. I understand that roblox couldn't know that this was a harmless game and because adopt me is so popular many people make clones to scam Childern. It sucks when you have a account with hours or even months of time in games and your  progress is just one day gone. But unfortunately I don't believe there is much you can do except make a new roblox account.,2021-01-30,1611966953.0
r/roblox,"This sucks, it seems like some stupid bans have been happening within the last while. one actually had the same ban reason yet the developer was not even trying to do that. and this was a well known dev or someone that's been doing this for a while.

I find it a bit harsh, sure there are people who do, do that kind of thing, with places that you do into and it makes it seem like its a way to get free robux etc, and asks for your account info. those type of people need to be banned on the spot... however for things like this and im sure it may happen more then often, they really need to up their moderation and actually look into things. I'm not sure if its automated or done in person, but things like this should be a warning, like say one warning and if its done again then a ban.

hope she gains back her courage, and presses on start with building and get good with that, then as she gets a little older maybe start scripting. I'm primarily a builder on the platform, been building since 2013, at first builds might look simple but as you go, you get better and develop techniques and your own style.

As for scripting, I would recommend not following tutorials on how to make something, and focus on the fundamentals of it first, then after you get a understanding, then go and try the tutorials, but start off with simple things.

A good Youtube scripting playlist for beginners that is more up to date and one I had started to follow within the past year some is AlvinBlox's 2020 beginner scripting series [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTth8CE\_os8sog72YTMLPhDSf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTth8CE_os8sog72YTMLPhDSf)

Another Person you can check out is DevKing [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ)

There are more good people on youtube who do scripting tutorials look around, different people will have different things they cover.

Another good resource would be the Official Roblox Developer Hub, [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/) it has different guides and references. If and when she gets to a point where she is getting into advanced things the API references or in general is a good way to see what different things are for and how to use them when scripting or building

Like others said, its best if you avoid the toolbox, only use it for audio, plugins (make sure the plugins are legit ones), Skyboxes etc.

Good luck, would be nice if this got to Roblox some how and they were able to properly recover your daughters account, because not only does it suck because whatever she may have worked on is gone, but all the items and game progress.

r/roblox,"I mean, it's probably albert (flamingo) that she watched, I feel bad, but y'know, I guess in the end, I'm sorry to be really harsh but I guess roblox can do what they want, and technically you did break their ToS. I mean, if she sold gamepasses for robux (which she probably didn't do) I could understand why they'd ban her, but since she probably was just trying to mess around a bit, it's kind of up for a moral debate about whether they should've banned her. But I do encourage for you to try and get her to find her interest in roblox once again, and try and use this as a lesson. Teach her about ToS, I have a 4 year old roblox account, if I lost everything, the hours I've played, it would definitely suck. I'm just glad she didn't loose 4 or more years of progress. I hope you can recover fromt the situation, and have a good day. If it was a backdoor, and it sold something without your permission, but if you did get screwed over by roblox, I'm deeply sorry. Have a good day",2021-01-29,1611941659.0
r/roblox,"One thing that might also be the case:

I'm not 100% sure if it is the case, but one important thing about roblox's ToS is they will ban users who use datamined content. Basically, if your daughter had used any assets from anywhere (even on the toolbox; others may have spread it and are vunerable to the ban too) that was not made public from the original devs in the form of a custom license or whatnot but have had people break into copylocked games and datamine and rip assets from them, using any of those at all will get your account banned. It's pretty sad but I can understand why they're doing this: usually from it can stem a lot of other more serious problems.",2021-01-30,1611988980.0

As someone who has got warned one time and never again, I still can say that appeals DO work, but I don't know what the hell your child put into the game; but I know that it's a backdoor put into the model. Some people like to add scripts into free models in the Toolbox section of the program that do stuff like pop up a store that's worth X amount of Robux, which will be stolen, redirect you to a phishing game or something similar, which may steal accounts, passwords or Robux. It's not a backdoor, it's a script that's designed to do a malicious thing, I understand that your kid is a kid, so according to them, it was innocent fun. Roblox Studio is truly a great, and creative thing and you SHOULD let her use it, but warn her that she shouldn't use player-made models in risk, that the account may be marked as phishing/scamming, and terminated.",2021-01-30,1611999680.0

r/roblox,"A popular youtuber, Flamingo also got banned because of using free models. The toolbox is quite dangerous and she should only use it if she has to. Seriously though. Roblox Studio is an amazing program but with all the people on there that create backdoors it's dangerous. Though, i remember... There was a skybox on the toolbox on the front page warning people of backdoors, i wonder if it had been banned because it had been botted to the front page because of the urgency of the situation. Roblox is as Roblox is. They are a multi-billion dollar company and you can do very little to change their ways.",2021-05-21,1621601845.0
r/roblox,"Yeah, I certainly learned a lot during this process.  Thanks for additional possible information, malicious scripts does seem very plausible.

Calvin's dad talking about pain building character wasn't wrong, it's mainly hard to watch your kids go through it.",2021-01-29,1611952199.0
r/roblox,Thanks for the resource links!  I'll check them out.,2021-01-30,1611978058.0
r/roblox,"Yeah, the learning points are valuable, if very painful.  She certainly understands better on what a ToS now and probably is much better equipped for navigating similar situations.  My main issue is closely tied to my high expectation of Roblox in general, so the fall is higher.  I get that Roblox can do whatever they want, I am well seasoned in tech ToS, its the downstream support that has truly failed in this equation.

Edit: Not sure what it says that you can peg the youtuber by such a generic example ha.  Needless to say she doesn't watch Flamingo anymore.",2021-01-29,1611952560.0
r/roblox,"I mean yeah, that is the lesson learned.  I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that a model that you can select from a default option in the Studio should not contain viruses and scripts that can lead to your account being banned.  It's not like she was sideloading models from a shady warez website.  It is literally a button right at the top.  

Expecting them to make sure there are no malicious resources loaded into their own system is not an unreasonable assumption, especially for a system designed for a younger audience.  If any piece of business software had resources with that kind of possible dangerous exposure they would have been sued out of existence a long time ago.  

I have a fine tuned danger meter for things from the internet, I watched her build the thing and at no time did I think what she was doing could have been dangerous.  It was a piece of tribal knowledge.  Even just a pop up that says ""resources from the Toolbox may contain malicious artifacts"" or something to that nature would have been the bare minimum and would have certainly prevented this from happening.

This is a platform for children and teens primarily and the gating that Roblox has put around their tools is shockingly terrible.  It is further compounded by an obviously paper thin moderation process.  If it is true that the ban was a result of a model loaded from the Toolbox (which appeals refuses to comment on) it is absurd to move directly to a ban, especially with zero warnings.  Those warnings could be in the form of the aforementioned popup on creation or a first time offense warning.  

I get that Roblox is suffering from growing pains, but it is no excuse for the piss poor result.",2021-01-30,1612003159.0

r/roblox,"Do you remember when Adopt Me was a game where you actually adopted and took care of a baby?
I do, there was no pets or trading and many people were happy and were roleplaying. 

I roleplayed with my friends at times in adopt me and we pretended we were some big happy family. 

Now, I don't even play anymore because it's kind of boring and dislike it. In my opinion, there's not much to do that doesn't involve having to spend money or have a chance to be scammed. It's barely a roleplay game anymore, since most of the chats are for trade requests. (ABC IF YOU HAVE A DOLPHIN YOUR WILLING TO TRADE!!!) 

When you do get into a family, it seems not much like a roleplay still. The thing you are adopting isn't a child, but a pet that costs money. The pets can be potentially scammed and spend a lot of money to buy certain features (fly and ride permanently). To get certain pets you have to pay extra robux which in my opinion seems to always be overpriced.

I did some research and found out this same group ""groups major lead game"" has done this to many others.  Ive emailed and called support and am awaiting a response.  Is there any chance he gets his robux back?  If not, what is the point of even purchasing robux if they can be stolen at any time?

I know almost nothing about this so any feedback would be appreciated.",2017-09-03,1504397767.0
r/roblox,"While I'm not roblox staff, I'll try to answer some of your questions.

**Is there any chance he gets his robux back?** - Yes, if you contact Roblox support fast enough. Usually they'll be able to do it(but only once) as long as it's done within a certain timeframe(14 days).

**If not, what is the point of even purchasing robux if they can be stolen at any time?** - It cannot be stolen at any time. Your son made a mistake by trusting a stranger and giving away either his access codes(password, pin, etc) through a phishing site or bluntly stating it out to them, downloading something that contained a virus, or having an easily guessable password and not having two-factor authentication or anything of the sort enabled.

**And how do they allow these scammers on their game to steal from kids?** - They do not, but it's a game of cat and mouse. Many online games/game platforms tend to have people who want to scam, because there's typically someone who's scummy enough to do so. Roblox has a large younger playerbase who plays games on their site, so it typically tends to be much easier for them to do so there(as much as I like to say a lot of children can be smart, there's plenty of them who are gullible for things. Maybe it's the santa claus argument again.) 

Roblox has made an effort already to make it harder and harder for the scammers(they've removed the entire commentary section on games because scammers were spamming it 24/7. They've hid the serverlists recently so that the scammers have a harder time getting the names of everyone to send messages to/friend requests to, and so on. But no matter what, as long as there is valuable currency at stake, scammers will be active.

Roblox is a game platform at the moment which has a MASSIVE playerbase, and there's so many games on the site that they cannot moderate them all, since players themselves are the ones who develop the games. I'm assuming your son most likely entered his details either through a site that looked much like a real roblox site(phishing), through a in-game place that he was linked to, or through any of the previous stated.

r/roblox,"I also recommend that you enable other security settings so that it's harder for people who somehow end up with the password can't access it.

In the security settings - you can set a parental pin(it's basically a backup password inside of the options menu so that nothing can be changed without it.).

You can also set up two step authentication with a verified email address for the extra bit(basically it'll make anyone who tries to login have to get a code that is sent to your email, so in that case only you would be able to access it.)",2017-09-03,1504400477.0

First, like most people already mentioned, it’s full of players that beg for robux/donations. Moreover, it doesn’t really make sense (imo) why most players getting the most robux are only selling badges. Basically, it ruins the game’s purpose of showcasing one’s talent in creating usable Roblox items.

r/roblox,"I spent 4 hours there and only got about 100 robux from it. Why? Because all the rich people are donating to other rich people. Someone with 100k donated to someone that had almost 1m donated to them already. Rich people get richer. 

I actually need Robux to fund for a game I want to make and try not to beg. Instead I just stand at my booth, occasionally asking people with more money but mostly just staying on my stand and dancing or something. But I almost never get donations. It... sucks. Someone who actually needs it isn't getting anything, but someone that already has tons of money is getting loaded with Robux.

I want to make a 20th anniversary game for Roblox, but I don't have nearly enough money irl to just buy 200 dollars worth of Robux. So I need to rely on others to help.. which never happens.

I've been playing for about 3 days and still only have 143 robux raised, in comparison to the rich people who constantly get donations. It makes me feel ashamed of not having money IRL or in an online game.",2024-01-26,1706304617.0

it's thanksgiving and my cousin is telling my sisters about how her son has been playing roblox for years and after a year of playing, my cousin made her son his own account. he's been playing for years and has a good following,and she and her son have spent money on this game (fyi i've never played this game/app) so it's something that her son cares about.

one day her son came up to her and asked to put in the password for the account. she thought he logged himself out but apparently some youtuber was scamming him. unfortunately my cousin put in the password and their account was gone.

My son plays, I don’t, though I’m a bigger gamer than he is. So I’m at a loss on how Robux works in some games or if there’s a way to contact devs and was hoping someone can help. My son on several occasions has been upset that he used his Robux then went back to the game and the thing he bought he no longer has access to (abilities, gear, etc.). That in turn frustrates me because we pay real money obviously for the Robux, then to find out once he’s logged out and back in he’s lost it, I almost wonder if some of these games are scams that you pay and lose whatever you paid for. Does that happen? Can they get you to pay Robux and the item is only good for that one session? Is there really no way to contact devs for support on their titles?",2019-06-11,1560278295.0
r/roblox,"I think the easiest way to explain it is Roblox isn't a game on its own, but rather similar to Steam where it hosts a ton of games made by independent developers. 'Robux' is basically used as a middle-man currency to purchase stuff in different games.

Let's say there are two games - Phantom Forces and Apocalypse Rising. Both have their own 'ingame' currency that they use, which is purchasable with Robux. Neither have any direct connection as far as I'm aware of, so nothing purchased in one game works in the other.

For gears, there are a lot of stuff that you can purchase on Roblox's official catalog. **This is purely cosmetic** - most if not nearly every game on the platform does not support Roblox's own official gears because it wouldn't work with their games well/they have little control over the balance of it.

And yeah, there are some games on the site(they disappear fairly quickly though) that show up as scams. Generally it's easy to tell for the average user(giant screen-blocking microtransactions everywhere and generally poor quality games), but for a kid not so much unfortunately.

There are some games that have items specifically only for one session. Usually they'll specify it in their descriptions before someone purchases the item.

Some devs have twitters(usually they block off their mail on the Roblox site since they tend to get swarmed with mail if they open it up) that you can reach out to them, or discords.

Wow, how things have changed. I don’t even know where to begin. At first I was hesitant to return as I’ve heard negative things, so I didn’t want to ruin my memory of the fun times I had, but they were hella wrong. At first I noticed there weren’t any guests, which was quite saddening but I get the reasoning. So I went to go make an account. The amount of usernames that were taken is absurd, then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least. But after like a half hour I finally got in. The front page pretty much looked the same. It didn’t have my classic red R but that’s okay lol. I didn’t know what to play as there were tones of games, but then I found murder mystery 2. I’m glad murder mystery games were still around so I clicked it. At first it was pretty normal, lobby, spectate and the shop. Then I went into the back room and figured out you could vote which was pretty neat (i don’t remember if they had that before). Besides that it felt a bit small but was pretty great. Other people in the lobby were dripped out, there was even a Coca Cola lady. Which was actually really cool. We load in to a game with this hotel type map. I got innocent. Which was expected lol. Anyways I noticed coins on the ground so I picked those everyone I saw up with out really worrying about the murderer. I didn’t realize there were so many hiding spots. Then I get earraped by this dude with a boombox on his back. You think for the hardcore censorship roblox does now, they would fix that. Anyways I heard a gunshot then we loaded back up into the lobby. We won :D. I went to the shop to see what I could buy with my coins then I realized you need to play for awhile just to get a knife. I went back to the front  page. I saw this game called adopt me was on popular so I decided to play it. I loaded in to this dope menu. They asked me if I want to become a baby or adult so I chose adult cause why not. I went into the tutorial and the amount of customization is insane. I left my house with this cool animation. Then a arrow is pointing me to a white wall. I go in then there is this beautiful hub.  Lots of stuff to do, I was overwhelmed. I make it to the middle which I was surrounded with stuff to buy. Then I got a pop up to buy this and that but a lot of it was Robux. I felt like I was in the middle of a Indian tech scam. Anyways I make it inside to adopt a child. Turns out no children were able to be adopted. But It didn’t bother me because I was to busy looking at all the cool animations. I go back to the front page to realize all the extra details they had in the game now. Then something horrible happened, I went to go see how many tix I had but couldn’t find any. I google to see where it was but then they removed it D:. I thought that was a horrible idea but eh. That’s all I played so far and it was pretty good, besides all the Robux they wanted me to buy. I’m gonna try out some old games when I come back on. Anyways it’s pretty dope.",2021-03-14,1615744872.0
r/roblox,"Hi, I've formatted this for you quickly. It's a bit of a wall of text still but it might help people read through it.

The amount of usernames that were taken is absurd, then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least. But after like a half hour I finally got in.

r/roblox,"Can I recommend some games that you can play without using a lot of robux?

If you like fighting games, maybe try a game called Super Doomspire (it is one of my favorite games :)",2021-03-15,1615842360.0
r/roblox,"Adopt Me is the most popular game on Roblox. (Partly because it's got like a whole team of developers who add stuff all the time.) And just to clarify, everyone there is obsessed almost to insanity about the pets. No one cares about the actual ""adopt a baby"" part. Basically the amount of robux you spend determines your popularity there, and the rarer the pet too. It's actually a really fun game though it's roleplay, but it can get crazy from all the beggars and constant bragging in the chat.

And here are some games I like (and many others like too):

Jailbreak - A pretty cool two-teamed game, where you can be a criminal or a cop. It has many things you can do, but more choice when you're a criminal.

Tower of Hell - I ***do*** like it, I really do, though many people get really frustrated by it. (Which I can *definitely* confirm.) Basically, it's a randomly generated tower of obbies, and you have a time limit to get to the top. And yeah, it's more fun than it sounds.

Piggy - A horror-styled puzzle game, where there is a ""piggy"" who needs to kill all the players before they escape the map. And the sound effects make it like 10x spookier.

Flicker - I know it's not too popular, but Flicker is a spooky-ish mafia styled game where everyone gets a role, either good or bad, and needs to vanquish the other team. (eg. if I were the murder, I'd need to eliminate the good team with my evil teammates to win.)

Anyway, I'm happy for you. Roblox is a good game though considered childish, and it's also a tool for game creation and even moneymaking. And yes, it *has* evolved. You should search up ""rthro"".

Edit: Rthro might seem creepy at first, but trust me, it's only in the face.",2021-03-16,1615856283.0

r/roblox,"Roblox account constantly being hacked
My boys both love playing roblox.  But their accounts are getting hacked, someone is stealing their robux and just generally ruining this game experience for them. I've told them to quit playing because it's pretty obvious that administration doesn't give two shits about account security. But they love this game. 
  
What are they doing or not doing that is allowing this to continue to happen? My son's account was hacked last night, changed his password, ruined one of the groups he built. Last week someone took ""donated"" all of their robux. Wtf?",2016-09-11,1473604286.0
r/roblox,"The only way to gain access to someone's account on Roblox is by directly receiving the users password from the user. 

In other words, there is absolutely no way to hack the Roblox Website and get access to a random players password.

Some if the ways this ""hacker"" gets access to the account are:

•Phishing: They make a scam website usually promising to give free items in game and requiring to log in with the player's Login Info on their website. This basically means the player was fooled to directly give the ""hacker"" his Info.

•Becoming friends with the player thru the inter-web or in real life and asking for Login Info

•Player accidentally reveals Login Info

•There is malware in the players computer, usually caused by clicking unknown links, that has a keylogger (records each one of the player keystrokes)

Hence said, the only way a ""hacker"" can gain access to your boys' accounts are by directly receiving their Login info. ",2016-09-11,1473605747.0
r/roblox,"For the account:
Find and wipe any possible malicious programs that can use your computer to get around logging in on their end. Then once again reset all passwords (roblox AND email)

And for the group, do you mean the attacker donated all robux to a group or wiped all funds from a group? ",2016-09-11,1473605418.0
r/roblox,"I'd suggest sitting down and talking with the two of them and just asking a few questions, make sure they know they are not in trouble, and its just to help understand how things are happening.
- Ask if they have been messaged by anyone saying they can get Free Robux, or been sent any other links.
- Ask if they have read any comments and visited sites mentioned.
- Ask if they have told anyone else their passwords, and if they've not, ask if they've changed their passwords after its been hacked to something very different.

After that, you should know if they need a little bit more internet savvy, or if there is another problem.
As suggested, do a virus scan, ESPECIALLY if they haven't done anything of the above. 

Out of interest, may I grab the names of the accounts? I'm not a crazy hacker dw, but it may be worth checking google to see if they have landed in any ""password folder"" type sites.",2016-09-11,1473607149.0

100% they gave away their passwords or have a really simple password.

First option -please press the 'log out of all other sessions' button, and change the password. Both are in the settings of the account.

Add an email with a different password. If it is already verified then secure that email.
