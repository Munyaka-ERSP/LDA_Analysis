saddening but i get the reasoning so i went to go make an account the amount of usernames that were taken is absurd then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least but after like a half hour i finally got in the front page pretty much looked the same it didn’t have my classic red r but that’s okay lol i didn’t know what to play as there were tones of games but then i found murder mystery i’m glad murder mystery games were still around so i clicked it at first it was pretty normal lobby spectate and the shop then i went into the back room and figured out you could vote which was pretty neat i don’t remember if they had that before besides that it felt a bit small but was pretty great other people in the lobby were dripped out there was even a coca cola lady which was actually really cool we load in to a game with this hotel type map i got innocent which was expected lol anyways i noticed coins on the ground so i picked those everyone i saw up with out really worrying about the murderer i didn’t realize there were so many hiding spots then i get earraped by this dude with a boombox on his back you think for the hardcore censorship roblox does now they would fix that anyways i heard a gunshot then we loaded back up into the lobby we won d i went to the shop to see what i could buy with my coins then i realized you need to play for awhile just to get a knife i went back to the front page i saw this game called adopt me was on popular so i decided to play it i loaded in to this dope menu they asked me if i want to become a baby or adult so i chose adult cause why not i went into the tutorial and the amount of customization is insane i left my house with this cool animation then a arrow is pointing me to a white wall i go in then there is this beautiful hub lots of stuff to do i was overwhelmed i make it to the middle which i was surrounded with stuff to buy then i got a pop up to buy this and that but a lot of it was robux i felt like i was in the middle of a indian tech scam anyways i make it inside to adopt a child turns out no children were able to be adopted but it didn’t bother me because i was to busy looking at all the cool animations i go back to the front page to realize all the extra details they had in the game now then something horrible happened i went to go see how many tix i had but couldn’t find any i google to see where it was but then they removed it d i thought that was a horrible idea but eh that’s all i played so far and it was pretty good besides all the robux they wanted me to buy i’m gonna try out some old games when i come back on anyways it’s pretty dope

and take three deep slow breaths we've even quantified it which actually helps him understand a lot when he's super crazy and out of control that's a normal breathing is around a or but this slow grounding breathing is a he knows that he's not supposed to breathe at a all the time but we tell him to breathe at a to calm down and get control then start breathing normal at a but when he's playing and excited and having fun he can go crazy around or but even when playing if we tell him he's at a he knows that's always too much and he needs to calm down like i said it took some doing to get to where he can do this but he likes numbers and likes to quantify most things numerically so for him this helps a lot second example i'll play games with him and as we do i let him win sometimes and i make a bit of a show when he beats me like oh man i lost you beat me good job acting disappointed but not sad or frustrated and still making sure he sees i'm happy again not upset but then i'll beat him in the game and of course he gets upset so i use it as a deliberate teaching moment like hey you did really good it's okay to be disappointed because we all want to win disappointed is okay but getting mad isn't instead tell the other person things like good job you beat me i'll get you next time and then you practice and get better and better after trying to tell him then i show him by letting him beat me again and i make another show of disappointment with that exaggerated oh man you got me again but making sure to laugh and show him i'm still having fun then actually pointing out see i lost but i didn't get upset i'm telling you good job and giving you a high five and we're still having fun trying to teach and point out the example sometimes i do something similar with single player games been playing some rogue legacy lately when i get a chance and i took time to point out to him that i get disappointed sometimes with dying which happens a lot in the game being a rogue like and all so i try to be an example letting him know it's okay to be disappointed but not to get mad again occasionally making a show of it for his sake; oh man i died again but that's okay i'll just try again and get better and better that sort of thing making sure to teach actually give an alternative behavior instead of a flat no don't do this thing nobody especially kids do well just being told don't do x but if they're given an alternative it generally always works better instead of a don't it's a try this instead for both the whole breathing and sportsmanship thing being told calm down stop that behaviour doesn't usually work but do this behavior instead works more often but full disclosure i'm not perfect at any of this and kids aren't obedient it never works perfect and sometimes it just ends up with everyone upset and in thier rooms for some needed quiet time that's just parenting edit wow this got a lot more attention than i thought it would i just hope it helps a few people out there every kid is different and this might not work with all kids but hopefully it's given a few parents some ideas parenting is hard so good luck to all you gaming parents who see this

quality ones interesting that you ignore every single argument except the one you could superficially tackle you think that this is a gotcha its not the issue is not that there is a lack of quality content seperate people have tried to explain this to you lets try it real slow for you kids like different things than adults they lack experience and maturity that comes with age they have under developed brains and like less complex things toddlers like peppa pig year olds do not likewise year olds have different standards than adults they lack experience knowing what is good and what they like they need to be allowed to explore their interests so they can refine them stop gatekeeping what people should or should not find fun even if your opinion is different some kids love pokemon scarlet and violet even with its deep flaws let them idk do you enjoy watching peppa pig with a cold beer or wine after a hard days work probably not all of that doesnt even matter except for the gatekeeping part all that matters is if someone buying the new pokemon game actually enjoy it kid or not its up to the individual if the price is worth it or not many people do think its worth it i do not i think its abysmal every cut corner possible moneygrabby and exploiting a loved franchise because its still an experience that is hard to find elsewhere my personal opinion matters not where other people get their joy from is none of my business how much they are willing to pay for that joy is not my problem *that* is the issue that you just do not seem to be able to understand you should not have to accept low quality kids content but you should not force them to engage with what you *think* is good quality content either thats up to the child to determine >i wouldn't allow my kids watching mlp that's for sure ironically modern mlp is fantastic kid content if you are actually a parent i can't imagen you spend a lot of time with them talk to them or understand them at all exploring different experiences and making mistakes is how we grow not allowing your kids to watch something they are interested in and is appropriate for the individual child they are all different after all is *actually* problematic unlike letting them explore interests even if you personally do not see the appeal i grew up next to a family that put their kids in a bubble they had no tv because the parents thought it rotted the youths brain not unlike how you think allowing a kid to play this pokemon game is spoiling them or letting them eat shit because they enjoy it amongst other media they stopped their kids from using so when eventually they were let loose in the world they were not prepared they did not get to try out things in a safe space with a parent to guide them and explain they had not gathered any of their experience's no likes or dislikes but they were hungry to find them so they tried everything having to catch up to their non closeted peers but without a solid fundation and safe space to return to every single one of them landed with bad people and struggeld with some form of substance abuse anecdotes are not proof ofcourse but preventing kids from making less than ideal choices does not actually help them guiding them through it does letting them watch mlp or what they are interested in and then letting them watch miyazaki would let them find out what they like instead of telling them what to like

final fantasy x that had some suggestive scenes etc and i just ended up sneaking it so they had absolutely no control over when i was consuming or going over to friends who were allowed it all the way back to when i was little and wasn't allowed to watch power rangers for the violence so i sneakily watched it instead porn blocks and strictly nothing with any suggestive scenes just meant that my friends and i ended up huddled around a library copy of clan of the cave bear a great book but having a brutal rape scene being our first depiction of sex written or visual at wasn't great basically kids will always find a way trying to dam the river often ends up in the dam breaking better to just try and channel the flow for example i asked my parents to let me get a tattoo at and they could have a say on it my mom was open to it as she knew i'd otherwise do it without their input on size placement image my dad just said no and that there was no way i'd be able to i had a palm sized tattoo on my ribs by the end of the weekend overall i think being very strict just breeds habits of lies and sneaky behavior anecdotally the kids i saw with super strict parents like mine acted out more once we could and just ended up lying more and having a worse relationship with parents as teens+new adults there was definitely a happy medium with some boundaries and rules but not always being on the stricter end of every situation too few boundaries also had issues in today's world kids are being brought into a different society than we were technology and screens are going to be a big part of that no screens at all during the week that's strict by anyone's standards an argument could be made that it could stunt their proficiency and intuitiveness with certain tech later on as is being proven by toddlers using tablets having earlier fine motor control and pattern recognition bbc documentary there are a bunch of studies and articles touting the positives of screens in moderation as tools for example my almost yo has coding apps for kids that he's allowed to play outside normal screen time vilifying screens and the virtual world is frankly reductionist; it's far more grey and nuanced than your comments portray now for roblox itself you call it stupid and that you admittedly don't get it that is you putting your judgement of its value over your child's its sheer popularity shows its entertainment value i don't get why my son likes some of the games he does but heck that's his free time and his choice to spend it how he likes we bond over watching him play together and keep an open line of communication skills that i don't **have** to watch every second because we've established what's not good content for him to play so he's come to me twice and said something weird came up like a jump scare game and he checks with me and we evaluate together same with youtube whenever he wants to play a new game in roblox we look through it together chat with nonfriends is turned off and we've never had an issue beyond the jump scare games touch wood and even the jump scare doors game we just play together and he watches me play and helps so we're laughing and joking as we play i love horror movies always have so i get his draw to the adrenaline of jump scares we just have open dialogues about what's appropriate same as watching harry potter and he knows there are more but we're waiting to watch them until he's older all of that to say what you express as fact is actually opinion as clearly i have some different ones and barring some of the research about the effects of screens on kis everything i've said is largely opinion based so maybe widen your point of view from stating opinions as facts and judging from there

old twins and one of my own and the step kids have absolutely no rules at their dad’s house they will sit up all night playing playstation and then have to go to school the next morning it would be possible to have more time here if they weren’t on their games non stop over there they have no structure there no chores no discipline no involvement from that parent at all he doesn’t go to doctor appointments conferences concerts sporting events nothing they eat only fast food and mountain dew they drink coffee all day and night loaded with sugar because they’re and nobody tells them they can’t so that’s what we get to work with my kids don’t play minecraft or roblox and we’ve told them early on there are absolutely positively no purchases on their devices as in if you can’t play it without paying for it we can find other games to play minecraft is just ridiculous… it’s a pointless game and if my kids want to gather dirt and rocks and stones they can go outside and do it we live in the country with acres of land most of which is yard and woods bordered by a river with fishing opportunities as well we have everything baseball stuff football stuff trampoline swings soccer nets and balls basketball hoop and balls a german shepherd who loves playing fetch sand box garden hammocks you name it… i even told them they could have minecraft back if they find four leaf clovers to get them to go outside and do something that was years ago they still haven’t attempted to find a single one we had to turn youtube off on the firewall level because they will sit and watch preston plays or ryan’s world and much like you i’d rather they watch better content they’ve lost privileges to use the browser because they were looking at porn it’s also worth noting that they have their tablets from pm mon friday and can choose a hour window each day of the weekend to play to noon or noon to they also have to have their chores done before they can get their electronics turned on outside that all their electronics are blocked from accessing the web rendering them essentially useless raising kids is hard this is all of our first go at it for the most part i parent my children the best way i see fit i don’t give a shit what other parents do you worry about the inside of your walls and i will worry about mine i know my kids have friends who have free use of their tablets and other electronics and when they come over to hang out it’s a massive fight getting those kids to go outside and play it’s always too hot or too cold or too windy or too buggy or it stinks or whatever i don’t care go explore the world you live in i look at that and realize i am doing an alright job with way i’ve got

small slights and racist content to offend others who are jewish another example of this is a recent trend of content hyping up learning german and content with the old germany national anthem tiktok does these influencing aborts that have mitifaceted parts to them visual audio written imprinting color schemes representative shapes music association parents don't realize that what they may be overhearing from their child's screen use isn't actually representative of what the child is seeing or what affect seeing iy and hearing what they hear is having on them if you notice a trend of the same song being played for multiple videos or repeated constantly odds are your child is being engineered right before you're very eyes my child developed an overwhelming urge to learn german and interest in all things german a few weeks ago i checked his watch history which means i have to watch every video he watched earlier sure enough the actual videos didn't correlate with the music or sounds being played and the colors imagery was even more disconnected yet was blatantly designed to be a serious form of brainwashing techniques things shown in the videos were carefully crafted to be swastikas even if it was something like the shadow of the tree branches with the sun behind them or cooking videos with a spliced screen of slime play the food would come out in the blatant form of a dick with balls while the slime would collate together as a blob swastika with the germany national anthem brassily playing in the background each short video had similar stuff with the song appearing for three videos and then reappearing after videos and it's almost always om sundays that stuff like this happens a few months ago it was videos of kids swimming or doing various forms of waterway all kids shown were white except the last kid who was black who inevitably ended up in some dear inducing position implications being that black kids are scared of water or dont know how to swim or get hurt when they swim the background music didn't lead me to feel the videos were problematic so just hearing them didn't set off bells or alarms it was the same type of repeated pattern for the song that caught my attention swastikas and dicks on a roblox game are definitely problematic

'feelings', 'everyone']",15018,so funny hang in there mama that said don’t feel guilty if you want to say something about it it’s actually not a bad thing to let your kiddos know if you need some quiet time or changes in topic from time to time teaching kids to have empathy for others is a great life skill for not only at home but for social normals with others no one would want to listen about how pink sparkly shoes are the best shoes in the world for hours right sorry it’s a weird random example but hang in there with me or maybe it’s been a long bad day and you’re just not in a mental state where you can hear one more freaking random fact about minecraft without wanting to pull your hair out despite all the love you have for your child and not wanting to crush their soul spirit willingness to share with you in the future but the really important part in teaching these lessons is that you don’t tell them teach this lesson when they are in the middle of sharing otherwise you risk hurting your child and making them feel unconfident in wanting to share with you again in the future do share with them how much you love that they are excited and happy about the topics they bring up that it’s awesome to share with people you love and you know care about you do listen when they share even when it’s not a topic you really care about it’s important to them and it’s the same way you would want to be treated when talking to a friend right do give them time to talk and after actively listening and asking engaging questions go ahead and change subjects to let your child know it’s time for something new to talk about if they don’t get it you can always say “it was really fun to hear about your minecraft story today but i would also love to hear about ” do share and talk about things you like or are excited about with your child too it’s a great way for them to learn about being good listeners and getting an understanding of how healthy conversations work keep in mind of your audience and where they are at developmentally though when bringing up your topics you might have to talk in excited tones and include exclude different facts when talking to a five year old but for a teenager you could have a less animated and more factual discussion do tell your kids when you are having a rough time or are in need of a break and try to tell them in advance so you can avoid hurt feelings example i’ve told my kids “hey i love you guys i just want to give you the head’s up that mom here has had a bit of a rough day i would be super grateful if we could talk and share things later when i know i’m not in a grumpy mood and i can give you the my best listening ears and attention that you deserve “ bottom line it’s nice to have our children share with us but it’s also good to have boundaries and to also acknowledge needs and feelings of everyone

'mistakes']",17056,i definitely hovered over her more i didn't allow her to do some things at ages that i have since let her little or brother do who is years younger than her i was very naive as a child and a teenager and i didn't want her to be the same i tried to prepare her for all the horrible people in the world and in doing so i projected my own insecurities and fears onto her luckily she is so emotionally mature and exceptionally intelligent that she does not have the same fears and insecurities however i realize i shouldn't have been trying to shield her as much because i could have very well given her the same fears and insecurities that i do have when she was she moved to montana to live with her dad because she had spent her first years of life with me and she missed her dad and her sisters over there and the biggest reason was that their high school only had about students whereas our high school here has over students so i agreed to let her move and since she's moved i've learned a lot of things i kind of put her in that older sister guaranteed babysitter role that she didn't need to be in i expected her to behave about years older than she always was because she was so intelligent and she was so mature i often forgot what a typical child her age would look like or how they would act because she never acted her actual age she always acted older so when we were at the mall or something for example if she had some behavior that was not typical for her but baby typical for an year old when she was she would get in trouble because we felt that she should be acting more like a year old so she ended up kind of getting small punishments because she wasn't acting her age in our eyes because we saw her as a year old but she really was acting her age and her own eyes because she really was an year old does that make sense it's really hard to put it all into writing because a lot of it seems very very small when you just write it out and list it i don't think that really shows the seriousness and the gravity of what i did to harm our relationship she was never abused physically or emotionally but she did feel like her stepdad and i expected way too much of her so she always felt like she would never be able to live up to her expectations she craved positive attention and we gave her plenty we thought but she has told me that she never felt like we were truly proud of her because we didn't act with as much excitement after her plays or when she aced a test or something like that a lot of the struggle for most of her childhood we thought related to the fact that she was years older than her little brother so even though we were treating them the same as each other as far as how we punished them or what kinds of things they were allowed to have it was at different times for example when my daughter was five that's when she started doing chores she started with simple things like putting her own clothes away taking out the bathroom garbage and maybe wiping down the bathroom sink by the time her brother was five she was so she had more age appropriate chores and her little brother had the same chores she had when she was five well in her nine year old brain she thought it was unfair because she had more to do than her brother i tried to explain to her that when she was five she had the same amount of chores but it was difficult for her to understand because she didn't remember well she has kind of felt like her little brother got better treatment his whole life because of things like that where i did treat him exactly the same as i traded her when she was his age she feels like we often favored him things like when her brother played baseball we would all attend games and we would cheer and tell him how great he did and all that stuff after the game but she never played a sport she was always in drama and i absolutely loved it she is so insanely talented and she has a real passion for acting and directing and writing but you don't really cheer during a play you don't shout over the crowd yeah good job way to remember your lines nice job talking loud enough for everyone to hear you but we said all of those things and more when it was over we gushed at how great she played her role but to her it didn't feel the same i can kind of understand that as i was in marching and concert band growing up and my brothers played sports my parents hated instrumental music and they absolutely loved sports but i recognize the fact that my parents were every one of my band concerts they always made sure i had my instrument and the things i needed to be able to play it they always came to parades or band competitions to watch me even though it was so dull and boring for them and they always told me how great i did and how proud they were of me and i could tell it was forced but it didn't negate the fact that they really were proud of me they just didn't know how to show it because they had only ever attended sporting events i guess she always felt that we weren't as proud of her as we were of her brother playing baseball which is completely untrue but i guess we didn't show it in a way that she could see it there are some things that she has told me that i don't understand or i don't agree with her viewpoint of how we acted or reacted or treated her in general but i recognize and understand that her feelings are hers alone and they're not for me to understand they're only for me to accept and i can try to ask for clarification and i can try to get some sort of understanding as to what i did wrong or where i went wrong and i might never get that all i know is that my daughter and i are not as close as we used to be and it hurts and if i could go back and do it again i would remind myself every single day not to make the same mistakes

then only showed up every few years i think i heard from him maybe on maybe birthdays out of the he missed before i was an adult but whenever we saw him we got to go do fun stuff like go to amusement parks go see movies go shopping and do all sorts of stuff we never got to do with my mom now that i'm a mom i understand it was because she didn't have the extra money and my dad skipped out on child support he was so good at that he'd only stay at a job long enough to have paycheck garnished for child support and then he'd quit and get a new job somewhere it usually took months to a year for support services to find out his new employer and start the garnishing process over my mom got maybe support checks from him over the years of my life that he was absent it should have been a monthly check so that's checks roughly and she got maybe 😒 but she never said a damn word about my dad my mom has her faults too she has said some things that were pretty damaging to me things that insinuate that i'm not a real mom because i had c sections and occasionally the same thing your mom does and she always sounds like someone else has it worse off than me and it's like sometimes i just want to be able to be upset without having to compare my life to someone else 🙄 and she's one of those who thinks that because she did something she hated doing as a parent then we my brothers and i should too for example christmas time my whole life i thought it was completely normal to have to go to different houses for christmas one side of my family rotated each year so occasionally christmas would be at our house but usually we weren't home for christmas at all we woke up opened gifts and ate breakfast and then left we didn't get to use play with our presents until we were home later that night when my husband and i got married he spent the first year doing christmas with me as my family normally did it as all of his family lives mi away after that he was like nope i'm not doing that every year our kids should get to play with the stuff we get for them that's the best part of christmas i never realized it was weird so when i explained to my mom that we'd be missing over half of the christmases and told her that if she wanted to see the kids open their gifts from us she'd have to come over to our house she threw a fit saying things like well i did it and made it work and you guys never complained when you were younger i would have loved to stay home but i bit the bullet and went everywhere because that's what you do for family so she's not perfect and also has nearly empathy which is weird because i am an empath and people's emotions affect me at times but she's strong and supportive she's apologized for things she said and did when she was raising us and she said she also doesn't remember saying those things i think it's because parenting was a different mindset back then it was more about obeying and the parent is never wrong and such whereas i feel like today parents are much more aware of the words they say having an impact on their kids because we've all been to therapy now 😂

and from experience i know how that parlays into overcompensation and spoiling of one's kids but you're not doing _yourself_ or her to be honest an favours by not setting reasonable expectations and enforcing limits next time before you get her anything sit her down hey its tuesday that means we go to the store when we get there i will get you _one_ <thing she wants> but that's it until next tuesday and i mean it no tantrums no complaining and then do not under any circumstances go back on that until next tuesday if you do this two or three cycles in a row and hold to your restriction and promise then im willing to bet it goes away but during those first few cycles you're in for a rough time whining complaints im sorry i said one you got one that's it until tuesday be prepared for how you handle a tantrum my advice ignore her completely if she wants to flop on the floor and throw stuff and act like err a yr old having a tantrum ignore her i mean like make sure she doesn't hurt herself but otherwise whe she gets in your face and screams in your ear calmly turn to her and say im sorry you feel that way but you're not behaving very nicely come back to me when you're willing to behave nicely and not scream in my ear gonna be tough but it will bear fruit this will sound rather cold but i think its appropriate as a parent your job isn't to be your child's best friend if your child winds up being your best friend that's a bonus and of course im not saying not to love your child to the moon and back and show it every minute of every day but your job isn't to cater and pamper their every need and whim your job is to get them to adulthood and lead by example and part of that is learning there are rules and limits and expectations and boundaries giving them everything they want when they want isn't going to teach them to be anything but needy helpless codependent whiners edit another thing as i come back to this a few hours later you're the parent don't feel the need to ever explain or justify any rule or decision to your kids just keep it simple sorry we can't afford it what are they gonna do audit the books or no i said no that's all you need to know is no or and this actually worked with my kids yep i said so completely arbitrary reason guess what im the adult i get to make up arbitrary rules im the parent deal with it when you're the adult you get to make arbitrary rules for you kids circle of life go ask grandma and grandpa they'll tell ya the same thing they made arbitrary rules that i thought sucked when i was your age so im just passing the buck onto you < i like this one because it shows you acknowledge the unfairness i e acknowledge their pain shows _empathy_ you just don't care

stuff like this can definitely lead to kids losing their friends or being made fun of which is what makes it so difficult if this happens to you as an adult you can kind of tell yourself oh they'll forget about it because they will but when you're and all you care about is what other kids think of you it's so much harder if you can't afford real converse you don't have to buy them i think it's better to go for generic clothes shoes than to buy fakes though because when you wear fakes you're trying to make people believe you're wearing the real thing which is what makes it so bad in these kids' eyes they will probably care less if he just wears shoes from unknown brands but of course your son probably won't like that i think you should be honest with him and tell him that even though you know it's important to him and he wants to fit in you just can't afford it this year you can also try to buy used items of clothing since you can usually get name brand clothing for a fraction of the original price that way i know it sounds a little disgusting to buy used shoes but i'm sure if you sanitize them properly it's all good start having conversations with your son about what types of things are important in life because the truth is if these girls care that much about a fucking star on an overpriced piece of cloth they are superficial and of course they're probably superficial because they're also and terrified of being ostracized for minor social transgressions but it's still true that caring about someone else's clothes is superficial your son needs to understand that there are many things about him that are much more important than his clothes or shoes and he should focus on those if he wants to find real friends that care about him as a person and are there for him try to help him strengthen his confidence does he have any extracurriculars that he's good at and or cares about that's what really helped my son who is now and was also very insecure when he was around your son's age maybe there's someone in your son's life who can teach him how to respond to mean comments kids often respect other kids who seem like they don't give a shit and can come up with witty responses to teasing of course that's easier said than done and you can't really fake confidence when you don't feel confident at all in this situation it's really tough

it we live in florida and the school was cancelled because the hurricane ian was coming my wife was at work and i was staying home with our kids f and m i put my daughter down for her nap and my son was playing roblox on his phone i know i know i started getting the place ready for the hurricane by nailing down anything that can fly and getting all of the garbage together to dispose of it now we live in an apartment community and the garbage disposal is a minute walk from our building it's not a rare occasion that you would see cars with garbage bags on their hood driving by because the disposal is next to the entrance exit of the community when i got all of the garbage boxes together i asked my son if he wants to walk with me or to stay home he chose to stay in not the the first time although up to about months ago he was very apprehensive of staying home alone and would always chose the tagging along option so off i went and was gone for about to minutes on a way back i get a phone call from him his phone is fully functional and he has his own number he uses it to video chat with grandparents in ny or call mom at work i work from home and use mobile internet during trips before i could answer the phone call dropped i called him back but the line was busy i knew something was up so i ran home it took me about seconds after his call to get there when i made it he was in tears and on a phone with someone who i was pretty sure was my wife he saw me walking in said to whoever it was that everything is fine now bye and hung up i asked him what happened and he said he thought i was missing he said he needs to tell me something i said sure he said i thought it was an emergency and called sure enough his phone started ringing and it was a local police department calling back to make sure we are fine the lady said she received a phone call from a child stating that his father was missing i assured her that everything is fine indeed and i was only gone for minutes taking a garbage out prior to hurricane hitting the area she said thank you for confirming and that was the end of it but my son was in so much stress he thought the police will come and take him away from us and place him with foster parents his best friend's parents are going through a really bad divorce that's where he gets his info from i did my best to convince him it is not going to happen unless he will continue calling the police every time i'm gone for less than minutes obviously i'm not going to leave him home alone again even if he begs me to we had a long conversation about what real emergencies are and when it's a good call to get the police involved he was shaken for about minutes or so after it happened and then went to his usual self he brought it up again when my wife came home and we went through what the emergency situations are again he truly believed it was an emergency and i was lost or something that is why he made a call i blame roblox he might have lost the track of time playing his rainbow friends game for context we never left our kids home alone not a single time cleaning outside or walking a dog if they don't want to join but can still see us is the only time when they are inside by themselves anyway i would love if you could share similar incidents and how you handled them tldr my kid called the police while i was taking the garbage out and he thought i was gone missing it all happened within minutes span ps i see that some of you have different opinion whether or not my son should have a fully functional phone i want to make it clear that i see no harm in him using his phone and play some games on it he gets about an hour of game time per day he may still use his phone for other tasks like reading math drawing etc all of it is easily controlled through parents app and phone settings when i said i was blaming roblox for what happened i was making a joke i'm not taking his phone away from him downvotes will not make me do it as well

for my mental health but not always kid and husband play overwatch monster hunter lol borderlands etc our video game budget is intense i was always into it too when game boy first came out i saved up so much christmas birthday and odd job money to buy one i also saved up and bought my own playstation when that came out my little brother was so mad i took it to college with me now we have like gaming pcs switches multiple consoles from various generations the fastest internet money can buy you will often find some combination of us bonding by playing video or tabletop games together i have passions outside of gaming i ride horses and mountain bike and love hiking and kayaking and the outdoors i like making art i'm not good at it but i do it anyway i love going to concerts and music festivals and we bring out kid to them when it is an appropriate band s venue etc i have no issue at all with role modeling enjoying gaming to my kid i do also like to role model having a variety of hobbies and enjoying physical activity and nature but i like those things if i didn't i might not force myself to role model doing things i don't enjoy beyond that having some physical activity in your life is like eating vegetables just something we need to teach our kids is important to their health i have seen no bad outcomes from this i have never gotten on the screen time will rot your brain train and never counted screen time minutes i just make sure there's plenty of good stuff and balance i'm okay with modeling that sometimes as an adult woman i am going to do my own thing and often that is gaming hell sometimes i'll leave the dishes undone tonight because i got a new game and i'm excited but i'll catch up tomorrow kid works hard in school gets good grades teacher has complimented his work ethic and said he tries hard he reads at or above grade level he's interested in so many different things he has great pc skills because he also gets into digital art on his pc and going into a word processor and writing stories if a question strikes him like a science question or something he googles it he's well mannered kind and polite funny thing actually last night my kid was asking me to write down his roblox account name so he could give it to a friend i was like dude you should make a little business card your name your roblox account steam account and nintendo

realized it didn’t work on google chrome only internet explorer don’t beat yourself up but i would definitely delete roblox i believe it needs to be installed on the computer for her to use it so delete the program that allows her to use the site and block the site mine was actually pretty ok with getting rid of it we had a talk about it and i know how hard it is to not freak out when you see something like that just try to talk with her calmly about it so that she feels like she can tell you things in the future have you had “the talk” with her yet i’d talked to her about sex briefly a few weeks before because my sister was having a baby and she was asking questions and knew virtually nothing about where babies came from but it is really hard to talk about what they’ve seen like i tried to basically tell my daughter that any crazy person can put things on the internet and that they can put some really weird stuff up there but sex is supposed to be a really special thing for two adults who have known each other a long time and love each other not something that people turn into something weird and put on the internet but people are crazy and so things like that end up on the internet it’s so hard to talk about without making them feel so embarrassed > i would be really careful about youtube too maybe put some screen time restriction on your computer so that she can only use it during certain hours when your home since you mentioned anime i want to warn you about those gacha life videos too it seems like a cute app for dressing up little characters but the youtube videos are almost always really messed up like of them even if they seem normal at first you’ll find something inappropriate if you watch the whole video try to steer her away from gaming channels too because that’s just going to make her want to play roblox and stuff like that more > it’s hard but for me i had to really find other things that my daughter likes to do like rollerblading riding bikes drawing on the computer or in good old paper she still plays her switch and has more than enough video games on there and a few on my phone as well just stay away from roblox no matter what and be really careful with youtube those gacha videos are what started my daughter googling “boobs” and she went down the rabbit hole for about ten minutes and ended up on some awful site we’ve been so much better off after taking a break from the computer and deleting roblox it was all she wanted to do for a while there she kind of reset after a week or so without it and is way more responsible with her internet time now only sometimes watching silly videos of glitches in legend of zelda or something usually she finds other things to do she’s been loving listening to music on alexa lately when she’s having some alone time in her room and she’s also gotten into reading a bit more and has been breezing through the harry potter series just try to find some other things she might like to do get a basketball net or some craft supplies or give her a little freedom riding bikes rollerblading in front of the house if you live in a good area for that the internet can be great but lately i think it’s a cancer when it comes to kids get her into some other stuff and i’m sure she’ll forget all about it maybe even have her take a break from it for a week or so explain your not mad at her or punishing her but you need to make sure it’s safe and it’s not healthy to be on it too often

if muslim muslim…whatever—reinforce the family’s faith if you’re not religious i guess this could be a good reason to look into religion we’re catholic but one of the books we’ve used is protestant growing up god’s way for girls because it seemed to have the necessary details but not too much so what i think really matters is that whatever you have is consonant with your values and does not confuse or disturb children

was using a discord server which i don't really know much about they were typing abt all kinds of things about half of it innocent but other inappropriate chats and memes being shared that aren't appropriate such as mild nudity more mature dirty jokes and even some mentions of violence that didnt feel good to see her talk abt especially on a chat site i never gave her permission to use oh and sailors they curse like sailors i confiscated her computer for the entire summer and by doing so she had an awesome productive creative summer break not staring at a screen in the last few days of summer i allowed her to get on roblox only and check in with her friends with the promise she wouldn't be on discord or anything else i didn't know abt today while she's been using the laptop i asked her to bring it to me so i could print something really quickly as i prepare the file i notice little chats pop up tiny in the corner of the screen i wouldn't have even noticed if someone didn't send a chat sure enough she's on discord again but with a kid i don't recognize chats going back to the very day her privileges were restored the content and messages were similar to the first time nothing pornographic but some with less clothes suggestive chats dirty jokes etc and sailors they still curse like sailors i was a teen mom and have been my daughters only parent now that middle school is here i'm realizing more and more how lost i am as far as parenting idk what to say to her how to punish her now on her nd offense how to support her emotionally and things i prob don't even know u should do i hate being mean and cold to her and i really want her to trust sharing things with me we've spoken about how she needs to earn my trust as well i just need some solid advice even tho i've been a mom for yrs i absolutely feel like a brand new mom again with the things coming up now that she is a pre teen middle schooler i never had a steady routine my parents weren't together while i grew up and my family has been pretty dysfunctional parents and ppl in general i'm trying to reverse as many of the negative habits passed down in my family as can i'm trying to find balance and figure our what my definition of a good mom is it's just so much i have to teach her that i don't even completely know and it's so overwhelming how do i help her through this emotionally without being too soft on her how would u all address this and what consequences would u give should i be mean or scary calm any experience with discord any and every other advice yall have is welcome i'm actually pretty hurt and disappointed that she'd lie to me by trying to hide the server and that i have to take back my trust in her i just want us to have a healthy mom daughter relationship and that's hard to build when i hardly know what one of those look like anyway i'm rambling if u read all this thanks i'd love to have someone to talk to and maybe get some advice

content i need some advice i f have a son m who loves youtube & roblox we have a computer that we'd put in his room because it was the best place to put in our house due to a lack of space he's also allowed to use my husband's phone to play roblox with his sister we do limit screentime & the computer has some intense parental controls but my husband's phone doesn't have these because it's his phone however my husband was going through his phone a while back & saw some p*rnographic pictures on there that he'd not saved there was also a very inappropriate video posted onto my husband's youtube account that had gotten flagged & taken down it had a video of woman in the background & my son face fully exposed in the foreground singing some youtube meme song we went through the phone & the computer & discovered that somehow our son had managed to turn off the parental controls & was searching p*rn we cleared the history so we could tell if he did it again reinstated parental controls & had a talk with him every talk has been met with extreme emotions he's on the autism spectrum & has always dealt with intense emotions we have to take breaks in discussions to calm him down before we can continue so this conversation was met with a ton of tears even some yelling and insisting it wasn't him all he does is sob & yell that he didn't do it we know for a fact that it was him it couldn't have been literally anyone else we even caught him in the act because we'd wanted to make sure we weren't misplacing the blame we figured out that when he wanted to search something up he'd shut his door & try to be very quiet turn down the volume everything he could to be inconspicuous but since his doorknob broke months ago & we haven't bothered to replace it yet we can still see into his room & caught him red handed i need to know what else i can do the computer has been removed from his room & the only way he's allowed on my husband's phone is when he's supervised & playing roblox with his sister we also figured out that my husband's phone has a kids mode that will keep him from searching things he shouldn't my biggest concern is what's made him want to look this stuff up he's never been exposed to any of this as far as we know we're very careful about not exposing our kids to adult things literally the only time he's not supervised by us is when he's with my parents who are even more strict than we are & when he's on the bus for school our only theory is that he's hearing things he shouldn't on the bus because he for some reason despite being a tiny year old gets placed in the back of the bus where all of the highschool kids sit he hates sitting back there these kids have been bad influences before & helped him get into trouble he's fully responsible for his behavior but peer pressure is pretty rough i'm sorry i know i'm rambling i just need some advice on what to do here

my daughter has had a friend in her friend group since yrs old pre k she’s now yrs old they go to school together i’ve known this mother as a parent at the school we never became friends but i’ve always remained friendly i’m an involved parent volunteer at my daughters school know her teachers help with homework and overall have a great relationship with my daughter i’m a good mother but as she gets older i believe she needs to navigate her own friendships i’m always there to listen if she has an issue or needs advice but overall she has a nice little friend group they’re a good group of kids however there is one girl whose mother has become overly involved in her daughters life to the point it is beyond helicopter parenting it’s like she has inserted herself into the friend group it’s… kind of weird honestly for example our girls there’s in the group have a group chat where they talk play roblox together or just facetime chat together there’s always lots of giggling and my daughter will share with me funny comments or stories sometimes however it has come to my attention that this heli mom will read their chats listen in on their conversations etc and then proceed to message the other parents she’s never messaged me complaining about what she heard or read and how they need to talk to their daughters about their behavior another parent in the friend group brought this to my attention as she was confused and looked through the texts but saw nothing concerning this prompted me to talk to my daughter and ask to see her texts i would like to point out i believe in protecting privacy and i trust my daughter i would never look through messages unless out of concern such as this and she knows that so together she and i went though her group chat and i also saw nothing concerning it was chatting about school stupid funny memes and roblox this heli mom wouldn’t elaborate to the other mom except to say that our daughters weren’t being “good digital citizens”… like what i believe this woman is controlling and bored and has no life or friendships outside of her daughter and is therefore inserting herself into her daughters personal life and friendships the worst part is the child of this woman is very sweet and likable but her mother is making it impossible for her to have her own friends imo knowing that my daughters own privacy would be invaded if she stays friends with this girl i’m considering suggesting she spend less time with her and not chat with her outside of school i hate this as i feel it has forced me to invade in her friendships thoughts or feedback * the above example is one issue i was also recently informed by another parent in their friend group that they no longer allow their daughter to hang out with heli mom’s daughter bc of similar overly involved behavior by heli mom *edit this isn’t about internet access i know and understand the importance of monitoring what kids see and do online my daughter doesn’t have unfiltered or unlimited access to the internet it’s about this mother reading their group texts they had via their ipads my daughter doesn’t have a phone listening to their conversations and then i don’t know commenting on it like texting the other parents that they aren’t including her daughter enough in their conversations despite her daughter being included maybe her kid had nothing to say that sort of thing it’s like she sits with her daughter during their group texts or facetime and gets upset that the girls aren’t asking her daughter enough questions or something i don’t know

got call a fucking camper over the tv he said to me daddy bad word why do he said that to me me well son you killed him times in a row the guy is frustrated that you are better then him just smile and take comfort in knowing that you beat the ass of this years old dude him does they know i am a children me nope it they did they would be worst him why me no one like to loose even less to a years old him so when people are mean they are jealous me exactly son take it as a proud badge of honour when they are mean its because you are good they cannot reflect on their own failure so they blame you instead of doing what you do daily getting killed until you are better and you become the one doing the killing him yessss me don't forget son when you feel the urge to be mean remember this moment remember why you feel like being mean before taking your decision him ok we cannot shape the environment to protect one feelings online don't feel the need to explain to others you will get hurt more your kid doesn't see it and you see their problem with your kid maybe you can teach her that if she create a different outfit she will have a better chance to be accepted i dont know how autism children are and how they understand those kind of concept if she do something see the results are better maybe she will get more curious you can read what create the problem she is having so you have some kind of power to guide your children if she can´t maybe you can set a server up for player on the spectrum if possible don't be sad for her she dont see it the pain you feel is related to your fear that she will have a hard time being accepted in life that people will be mean to her because they dont know her and they dont understand again i never dealt with an autistic children but that's where i would put the work first if i had this kind of fear explaining why she doesn't get the result she want showing her how to improve the odds working to improve the odds and hopefully get the result she want hoping this feed back loop would stick and re inforcing it through online play and hardship of online interaction this skill would translate real well in the real world kid her age will not adapt to her she will need to learn to adapt herself to others be thankful for those hard comments translate the problem they have with her in a way to empowered her to fix this and get accepted if it cannot be fix and people continue to find others reasons i would teach to let go and explain some people are toxic and will never be truly satisfied two key concept to learn how to get what you want and to let go if you cannot have it after trying really hard

are online hi all my son is only child and he is struggling to make friends at school and has made a group of buddies online with similar interests that live in other countries i worry that this is problematic for him to prefer these friends over his irl friends more details i apologize for the length my son is great his special interest is history more specifically military history he had a core group of buddies growing up but now that they are in middle school everyone has dispersed and gone their own way my son is now having a hard time relating to other kids his age he started playing roblox a few years ago and he formed a little “club” of what i am hoping are other kids and they all build and play world war games together there’s one kid in particular who he has bonded with a lot the kid lives in another country as do most of the kids in his club my son says that these kids are his best friends and are the only ones who he has common interests with i’ve vetted these online kids as much as possible i’ve read roblox conversations with them and it all seems like normal kid talk recently they did start a chat on discord so i’m monitoring that and again just seems like year old boys sending each other memes his best friend in the group sent a voice message last week to the whole club and it sounded like a year old boy it makes me sad he doesn’t have friends in real life covid was hard for him and very isolating since then he’s gotten closer with these online friends and i don’t know if this should be concerning to me i’m glad he has kids to relate to but it’s starting to get to the point where my son comes home frustrated every day because he says he’s “sick of the other kids” at school it’s making me concerned and he has suffered from anxiety in the past because he tends to go very hard on himself with school work he’s a perfectionist academically he excels he has straight a’s and has made honor roll every quarter he is starting a chess club at school and is participating in a geography competition this weekend i’m so proud but i worry about his preference for his online buddies over his real friends should i be concerned is there anything i can do to better monitor his online interactions or vet these friends eta please be kind i’m a single mom working full time with autism and i am doing my best and everything i can to make sure he’s ok i don’t want him to be lonely but also don’t want him to isolate himself i am in the process of finding a therapist for him but there’s always a wait his teachers say he’s doing great and his school counselor checks on him every month and reports back to me she says he’s a delight but he comes home annoyed and angry every day

been tough he likes playing it but there is always other things that he wants to do like roblox playing with the neighbours reading his minecraft zombie that he read in year he used to be more proactive in his younger days and improve very quickly when he was in kindy and year it slowed down a bit in year and but we understand because school is more intense but last year and this year it is always a chore to practice he would probably do it once per week he still enjoys playing but it seems that there are just other things he wants to do he would say he will practice but instead of heading to the piano he would divert to talk to my wife and then get distracted by other things if i am firm and insisting that he head over now he would say he is already heading over and then gets emotional and in a bad mood as if i have falsely accused him of something then if minor conflicts happen during practice and sometimes he really ticks me off and i can be mad at him it can escalate very quickly to loud incessant crying it does make me think that this is more of a power trip then unwillingness to practice similar with other stuff as well he was already moody when he came to practice today then he needed to check something i let him and he returns then plays for a few minutes and says he is tired and wants to go to bed i was a bit annoyed so i told him that he needs to play through the piece a couple more times before he can go to bed his usual bed time is not for another minutes i did raise my voice and i told him i am upset with him and this lead to him crying on top of his lungs for minutes until my wife came and told him to go to bed but on a good day like two days ago he worked hard he wanted me to sit with him and we go through a piece he is learning and he did well he also listened to my advice as well my wife has told him this year that he is wasting money having the lessons since he won't practice and did not improve she said a few harsh words as well which i think was not appropriate she said she was embarrassed that he did not improve for a year and that his friend who was way behind him had caught up already but every time we bring this up he is very insistent on that he wants to play and begs us not to stop the lessons i have learnt piano at a young age and i do know what it feels like when practicing is a drag however i did go through with it because i like playing and when i was good enough to play what i wanted it is no longer a chore to practice but at that time i was addicted to playing really professional pieces those ones that top pianist play at concerts so i improved rapidly my current thought is that i will tell him that we should stop the lessons if he wants to learn he needs to show it piano is there so he can practice if he wants we won't have lessons again until he can demonstrate at least willingness to practice a few times a week i play the piano myself so i can help him if he wants i tried teaching him before but he is fairly resistant taking instructions from me sometimes so we went with external teachers i guess if i play more in front of him it may stimulate him a bit more to learn i guess both him and the little one does like to listen to me play the only problem is that my wife hates seeing me play because if i have time to play then i might as well use this time to do the dishes or catch up with work etc it is not like i play bad i am good enough to teach professionally and my friends who plays music all highly rate my music i have high level diplomas to prove as well as a result i hardly ever plays since we got married she does praise him when he plays he can do a good job when he puts his mind to it perhaps i can try slip a few music that he may like and see if he will do it more he is currently into music from some roblox games and also geometry dash which is a bit hard to put on piano but then i got to get it past the wife first i think she is a bit set on stopping edit just to clarify things what happened tonight is not usual at this household if he does practice normally either me or my wife if not busy will sit in the lounge to keep him company and help him out if he needs like play the left hand or right hand for him etc or record him play the pieces he think he got it right and also this is like the rd time he actually sat on the piano outside lessons in like weeks so we are not forcing him to practice everyday and earlier today he was playing with the neighbours and got upset cos other neighbour who seems to be celebrating something was not home so he can't ask them what's happening he gets lots of love and attention as well

with her two kids at the very beginning of covid shortly after we had a baby who is now and a half her two previous kids are boy and girl their father is basically a non factor something i thought would change as he's gotten older and figured things out wrong he sadly still does nothing for his kids so their mom had basically been raising them with her mom and step dad who provided a solid foundation but instilled discipline something i quickly came to find out shortly after they moved in when we decided to move in together i knew there were going to be issues but it turned out they were a bit deeper than expected it became clear her kids absolutely ran over their mother in what i would consider extreme ways a bit shocking to me at first we'd been together for years at that point and while i hadn't spent the most amount of time with her kids i thought i had a decent feel for them as people typical spoiled & year olds not too unlike my own at those ages not correct the extreme tantrums would last minutes at a time until they got what they wanted to the point the boy would threaten to kill his mom an year old threatening to kill his mom in extreme anger was a weekly occurrence i was constantly picking my jaw up off the floor the first months they lived here with little idea of what to do to solve this problem four or five months in to our new living situation i had had enough something had to change i sat my gf down and told her her children's behavior was unacceptable and this can't go on she agreed and we decided to make some changes come to find out she was actually scared of her year old son and wasn't sure if he was displaying psychopathic tendencies i chuckled and even though some of the behaviors were very concerning this was not my take on the matter over the course of the first months i simply observed how she dealt with them on a moment to moment basis or when they needed some guidance her foot to come down to put it simply it just never happened until she had had enough emotional abuse and then she'd blow up to me it was apparent this was the first thing that needed to change but the hardest thing for her to hear she felt guilty about their father not being there for them and so felt the need to continually do everything for them while put up with their constant shit again until she snapped then become guilty for getting mad and would console them after she blew up it's her nature she's not a loud and overbearing person she's small and relatively quiet a bit of a pushover in all honesty ultimately i'm an incentives guy so we agreed on a couple principles mom needed to be more consistent we'd instill some notion of negative and positive consequences based on their behavior we first began limiting video games when behaviors got out of control this worked relatively quickly with the girl her minute tantrums reduced to or not at all almost completely cooperative with rare exception not the same for the boy immediate explosion this definitely caused a snowball effect in his behavior the tantrums got worse his extreme anger turned to nonchalant f you attitude and he turned to sneaking and lying which in turn caused consequences to become harsher and longer the fighting between all of us skyrocketed we tried everything from taking away video games taking away tv writing sentences chores extra chores and grounding none of this had any significant impact this turned into a year of constant never ending shit between the boy myself and the mom not only that but the boy began sneaking devices and anytime he did that would stay up literally all night he would be so tired he wouldn't go to school this would happen if not daily multiple times per week so a couple months ago we started looking at how he was being dealt with still inconsistency delayed consequences weren't having an impact and looking at why he was sneaking devices we came to the conclusion that consequences that were difficult to enforce were not working and were often too long mom constantly doing things for him that he can do himself was not in his best interest and we felt he had an addiction not necessarily to video games but certain easy win roblox games that basically gamify the child's attention something i'd warn all parents about i'm not anti video games in the slightest but these rd party roblox games that mine young kids' attention and desire for robux roblox money clearly can become addictive for an impressionable young mind so rather than long lasting and delayed consequences we shifted to a few things immediate corner time for bad behavior minutes at a time no delayed consequences eg have to write sentences i will not cuss at my mom or something before getting tv back etc that's gone we implemented a two hour window where he had to do something productive for himself before watching tv still no video games we give some structure for the time but he can choose what he wants to do for himself turned wifi off for all devices at certain times so even if he sneaks something he'd be shit out luck for playing the roblox games all night long say no to him whenever he asked for help for anything he can do for himself implemented a much earlier bed time so he can begin going to sleep earlier if he gets scared at night and can't sleep a common occurrence to explicitly not sneak he can wake me up anytime and we'll figure out how to help him get to sleep at first of course there was whining about the two hours of constructive time but over the course of a couple weeks he began getting pretty good at drawing he'd go outside a bit more play with the baby kick the ball around and he'd be more helpful with things we asked him to do while he still can't help himself with some of the sneakyness when a device has been left out most of the time he's been able to get to sleep before pm and he's come to us when he gets scared instead of choosing to take a device and stay up all night his attitude has changed dramatically to the point we haven't had a blow up fight in weeks win win win win yesterday i gave him back time with the xbox for the second time in about months or so he deserves it his attitude has improved to a point i'd call his behavior normal and he seems to have turned a corner with the extreme anger tantrums it's been weeks or longer we'll see how he behaves now that he had a good chunk of time with the xbox and i plan on letting him have some time today once he's done the things he needs to do but i'm proud of him and so is his mom we feel successful in our efforts and i thought it was worth noting and celebrating let's hope it keeps up
