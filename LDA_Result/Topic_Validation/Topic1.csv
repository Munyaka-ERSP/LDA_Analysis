comments and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a roblox shill or a year old kid that really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you as you're opinion's already been made i'm not sure if you know this but roblox does not make the games all of roblox's content is completely player made well with the exception of some events and tutorial games heck the whole point of roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games what does this mean any multiplayer game has the danger of adults and susceptible children meeting it's not a new thing usually the multiplayer game has safeguards such as safe chat child friendly mode or whatever but in the end it's ultimately up to you to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online the game can only do so much it's almost the same in roblox's case these are multiplayer interactions between players to players people playing other player's games not player to company you see that's the huge difference they can't be held accountable in the same ways i hope you understand that i'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason not because i only read a few sentences of your comments the solution is with you guys not the other way around look i understand that these practices are quite shitty but there's a real difference between actual scams and these scams i've seen games get taken down for real scams for instance you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t shirt that's a real bonifide scam meanwhile with your case you're getting what you pay for sure the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated but the gamepass never promised how long the game would last did it scummy but legal these practices are not criminal despite how close they may seem taking action against things like these leave a huge precedent and could be damaging for all of roblox let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of where does the solution lie that's right with you your son is choosing to play these games and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform he is choosing to play these scammy games despite there being tons of other games out there issues that are out of his control like nudity swearing etc that is the type of stuff roblox is trying to prevent children should never ever be taken advantage of by adults i agree but its the goddamn internet it never ever will be safe like c'mon if your child can't handle roblox maybe it's not the company's fault it's not roblox's job on how to teach your kid st century skills they do what they can but when it comes to issues born out of free will what the hell are they supposed to do your kid wants to buy this stuff and if it's due to manipulation and targeting then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit as long as free speech exists manipulation will too connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities you know that if you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing roblox if you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids then good for you you're making the choices here i've said my piece have a wonderful day

a moderation story i am pretty sure appeals is never going to get back to us with anything useful so i mainly want to share this so others don't end up in a similar situation at first i was just planning on posting up the very frustrating appeals emails with roblox support but i am not sure it would be helpful it seems it is well known that the appeals system is broken and not in place to assist users instead i am just going to post up about what led to my kids account being banned hopefully this can serve to prevent other young peeps from having a similar situation happen to them my year old has been playing roblox for a number of years and absolutely loves it we enjoy the freedom she has by being able to play a huge number of game types in one place and she even recently started to try her shot at making her own games she watched a youtuber create a clone of adopt me and wanted to try it herself danger zone at the time i was unaware that this was against the tos as there are innumerable such games all over roblox i imagined it would be a good way to get a feel for game creation and provide further ideas for how she might want to create her own games she found some resources in roblox studio from adopt me danger zone and whipped out a quick game at the time i thought nothing of it after all if what she was doing was a problem why would there be so many games that looked just like the popular ones a couple days after publishing her game she goes to her computer and it says her account has been banned specifically for creating a phishing game designed to scam other players i can assure you she has no idea what phishing is now she does because i had to define it for her so i guess the learning is a silver lining she only knows what scamming is in terms of what she should look for when someone is trying to get her to do something wrong she was devastated not only was her account banned but for a reason she didn't even understand she does extra chores for robux and invests real time and effort into the platform now she is not sure if she ever wants to put in the same effort again and i don't blame her after being hit with a capricious ban she doesn't even want to open roblox studio for the fear that what she might do could get her new account banned every time she goes to play an old favorite she has that halting realization that all the time she put into it was wasted and the robux she used to get vip is completely gone she tries to pretend like it's not a big deal but each time she tries something she used to do she gets real quiet and sad i tried to get more information from the appeals system as to exactly what she did that was considered phishing or scamming at best by looking here and in the devforums i believe she may have inadvertently used a resource that could have a backdoor in it without official confirmation this is complete conjecture appeals was unwilling to give me any actual useful information and has ghosted us on responses after the first few that were obvious form letters i mainly don't understand how it moved to immediate ban and kangaroo court appeals there is no room to grow or understand i am greatly disappointed in roblox a platform i had previously recommended heavily to friends and their kids but it has let us down immensely this disappointment is compounded even further by not having any useful official channel to resolve grievances literally the only thing i can do is post here on reddit which is at best just so i can say to my daughter that i tried everything i could think of maybe i'll wait for the ipo buy a share and go complain at an investors meeting i sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else as it was a fairly traumatic to a year old tl;dr be very careful about letting your kids use roblox studio as it may lead to bans for offenses they do not understand and you will not receive justification for also be careful what you let you kids copy from youtube giant important follow up after all the super useful information here i put in one last hail mary email to appeals about the free models containing malicious code and how it was unfair to expect a child to understand those dangers just got a response from appeals and they changed her ban to a warning which i honestly did not expect at all for anyone else in a similar situation i highly recommend persevering while also being unfailingly polite while the end result is a win i still feel roblox needs to improve their customer service i am just glad that at least some of my faith in roblox as an entity has been restored

won't bypass if you give them access to your accounts if you don't think putting a pin on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable why would you think putting a pin on the email account is reasonable given we see this kind of story frequently in the news this is not a one off problem it should be a regulation at this point because we clearly can't trust companies to voluntarily behave as for a dollar amount i'd set it around the price of a full fat game so £ i'd say the kid having to open a separate program entirely adds enough extra difficulty and friction to

parents weren't used to guarding the phone it had never been an issue before because the premium rate services were all targetted at adults the solution that got in place was incredibly weak shows were forced to say remember to get the bill payers permission before making a call but worked pretty well were there still instances of kids calling in without permission absolutely but much less than

other games i put this post on r truegaming but the mods there deleted it and some people are saying it was cause it was about roblox i am working on a small documentary series focusing on all the cruel and scummy things roblox has done the first one being roblox's discrimination against other gamers i often refer to roblox as the bully of all games due to most roblox players being absolute jerks towards people who play other games and roblox's actions against other games roblox gained popularity in the early s and was considered an icon at the start of the s however that start of the new decade brought along a small game that would unbeknownst to roblox become a more influential and greater game when minecraft came into being in after its alpha stage in its popularity skyrocketed it flocked to so many players due to its simplicity and hidden beauty in the roblox forums there was one player even suggesting some people check it out but soon roblox started banning players who said mc or minecraft in their forums they stated it's just for copyright reasons but it doesn't take a genius to know otherwise referencing the name of something in an online platform doesn't fall under any copyright rule or law henceforth this claim should be considered invalid it's also happened today i had a friend who mentioned he got banned on his alt account for saying minecraft and i met another person on roblox who had a similar interaction while it may seem less common roblox is still going after mc players they've also gone after other games like fortnite where they filed a false lawsuit against epic games over a logo the epic games logo looks like the square in the roblox logo but it's right side up this is a clear violation of the copyright rules which contain fair usage epic isn't making money off the logo and it's a square that's transformed from its original product however roblox still tried to sue fortnite but this eventually failed and fell through another redditor beautifully explains that one time roblox took full credit for another game's success a roblox dev quit roblox due to the moderation refusing the help with trolls copying his game and selling it for higher prices and studied unity to make another game when this game blew up roblox took full credit for something they had nothing to do with there have also been community oriented cases where far too many games are bad versions of the other games and in most cases these copies are behind a paywall while many could say this is for those who don't have the money to buy the real games the copies are behind a paywall still and their usually bad versions outside the platform roblox players would bully other gamers i've seen many videos of roblox kids trying to cancel random minecraft youtubers for no reason and i myself have faced lots of bullying and harassment for liking other games over roblox the worst part is people would support this and roblox's actions against other games this is why i don't like roblox they discriminate against other games and allow their users to do the same

underrated i think everyone here knows what roblox is roblox is a game where you can script and build games for an online community with millions of players it began development back in and was actually pretty good from after however the game got increasingly more popular the community just turned to utter bullshit minecraft youtubers started playing roblox and kids who played the game started uploading cancerous videos to youtube roblox became greedy and took control of this popularity and used it to get more money on the website every time you logged in you would get tix tickets and you use these tickets to buy things on the catalog or you could trade them in for robux the in game currency they took away this feature leaving the players to buy robux using real money or to buy their ridiculous membership to earn robux every day similar to the way you earned tix now roblox was making more money than they ever had before but then came the coders and game developers after roblox added a feature to earn money off of your games game developers came to roblox to use it's growing popularity with kids to earn lots of money and lets face it all kids are cringy and stupid this being said they like cringy and stupid things so said game developers made stupid cringy games and they got very very popular roblox’s community has grown since though so this means that more and more kids have come to roblox and started playing their toxic games roblox admins being their autistic selves remove features such as the forum comments on games and just recently game genres roblox’s reporting system is also ass if you report a hacker or an oder online dater literally nothing happens you can do literally whatever the fuck you want on any game and you will not be prosecuted by any means by the roblox admins so now i bet your wondering why are you still defending roblox by saying it’s underrated if it’s community is such a bag of hamster shit because the community and the staff is the problem the game itself is phenomenal you can download roblox’s free software roblox studio and use it to build games and upload them to the roblox site where you can play with your friends you can add extensions to your games so that it allows you to build within the game online meaning you and your friends can build things together wait anon thats just fucking minecraft no my friend that’s where you are wrong i’m not gonna get into minecraft and its community right now but i can tell you that roblox is better than minecraft not by the community of course but the gameplay in minecraft you are limited to blocks that are all the same size but in roblox you can have blocks spheres wedges cylinders and every other shape you can think of along with this you can also resize the blocks to whatever size you desire you can copy and paste blocks and structures as well so that comes in handy you can also import d models and animate things create cutscenes morph your character in game code your own add ons and weapons and so much more this is truly an amazing tool roblox at it’s core is a great game being fogged by the immature toxic community that its created

you can either block those games which you feel are inappropriate for a child’s given age or if you go with the limited “curated content only” your child is prohibited from chatting with any friends in any game whatsoever this seems entirely unreasonable the over under setting does little to nothing the “allow only curated content” still shows all of the user generated content simply with an x over the play sign so the child can still see everything they can’t play gets frustrated about it as they seek curated content and can’t talk with friends the “all or nothing” approach to safety and security for children feels more like mere lip service to parents who are trying to monitor their children’s internet time a or year old wants to play roblox so they can chat with their friends prohibiting this defeats the purpose of the entire platform and really prohibits the child from effectively playing many of the games which require some level of communication furthermore displaying all that the child is not allowed to play merely insights frustration as opposed to many other internet mechanisms by which a parent can block an app a website or a game that is inappropriate after which it no longer shows up furthermore many of the games in the user generated content are age appropriate for younger kids and are the more popular games so the curated option includes removing the ability for a child to play games which are both popular and age appropriate ie islands at the same time roblox does nothing to monitor inappropriate games with xenophobic or sexual themes and deprives the parent of the ability to block these games from a child the entire parental safety mechanism is wholly inadequate every other type of platform allows for customization of age rated games customization of chat mechanisms and the ability of the parent to help their child play safely this includes the internet itself where websites can be blocked or allowed lastly the ability to monitor roblox chats only along with inability to monitor in game chats without the parent watching live the entire time is a serious failure of the platform this system sets parents up for failure and promotes frustration and resentment with the children roblox claims to be concerned about the safety and well being of their players yet they take no responsibility for monitoring user generated content provide no realistic mechanism which allows a parent to work with the child to determine what is appropriate which varies greatly even between ages and and places all responsibility of reporting inappropriate content or behavior on the users which for the record they do little or nothing about i have personally reported games which i have witnessed sexual content and the encouragement of inappropriate and sexual behavior i have provided screenshots as proof i have received nothing more than a canned response saying i should enable “curated content” only and refusing to address the inability to chat once this is implemented i have reported games which promote violence in conjunction with xenophobic themes i provided screenshots in support thereof again i received a canned response about parental controls never mind the fact that child can create a new account with nothing more than a name and a birthdate which does nothing to block content aside from a few ### in chats at what point does roblox take any responsibility for their content and or lack of useful safety settings which would at least allow a parent to have reasonable controls over what their child can play and do on the platform if a roblox is going to market to kids from years of age see their toys to young adults there needs to be more than the current useless black and white all or nothing parental controls the technology exists they simply refuse to implement it and or make it available i can only assume their “concern for the children”propaganda is nothing more than a public affairs cya as they hoist all of the responsibility of monitoring behavior and content of their platform onto their young players which maybe just maybe would fly if they ever actually did anything about it but their statements re their concern are disingenuous at best given the lack of response when said reports are actually made this is not unreasonable and this is not the ranting of a parent who doesn’t want to monitor their child’s activity these are the words of a concerned parent watching a company market to millions of young children who are desperate for socialization especially during a pandemic and making millions on them and their parents while depriving users and their parents of the most simplistic of tools needed to ensure the safety and well being of our kids and on a final note the recommendations by some that parents can just block the game as a whole or just set the all or nothing restrictions and get over it is not a response or solution it’s ignoring the problem and passing the buck

also game together are roblox players and are very aware of this weird “headless” fascination now it’s so popular that kids are creating “fake headless” regularly now and this avatar isn’t even a new one crazy how it’s kept grown its popularity over time this is a tough one and it really depends on things imo what kind of parental controls you want to put on how your daughter spends her money and how much you want to encourage continued time and effort in gaming and her yt channel for us that amt of money is just too much for an avatar for a casual gamer however she actually did say to me that she could understand and justify that large purchase if she was a yter and posted vids like yours and had a substantial following we discussed it like an investment for someone trying to grow their youtube channel gaming experience sounds silly when referring to roblox i know but this is what kids do now and many kids look at this as a pathway to their future becoming influencers or gamers who post vids or a future in gaming development software prog coding etc this is what mine currently wants to do id say that if this headless purchase is something she’s been working towards with the intention of it helping to grow her yt gamer following and subscribers maybe let her do it esp if she’s still got another month before she earns the last if she’s still dead set on it id support it tbh it’s not much different than tween teens saving for that special “name brand” ____ or a new bike or computer accessory or whatever granted an avatar isn’t a tangible item but if that’s what your kid is into and they’ve worked to save up for it themselves… maybe have her make a list of what she’d spend her money on if the headless horseman was taken off the table is there anything else that she may have regrets about if she spent all her money on an avatar id definitely make them think on it for a while but yours seems to have done this and is continuing to do so as she earns the last of it she also seems to be making a name for herself and is pretty dedicated if her gaming and youtube channel is something you see continuing indefinitely and growing and you support her doing it i’d let her do it worst case scenario she has regrets later but the silver lining here is that she learns the invaluable lesson of how saving and spending your savings is such an important decision not to be taken lightly that will be ever present throughout life and whether she spends it on the avatar or something else she will also learn that building up your savings again like that isn’t easy and that could also help grow her appreciation for what it takes to save money and spend it wisely

frequently game creators can add in game purchases purchased with robux which can be special features like unlimited in game currency special boosts like being able to jump higher unlock special packs etc it’s not necessary to buy these sometimes it makes the game faster and easier there are many different types of games in roblox my family enjoys the “tycoon” games where you earn “money” or whatever you’re collecting in the game and build your “base” or whatever you’re building in the game there’s zoo tycoons building and customizing your own zoo pizza restaurant tycoon store tycoon mall tycoon etc since there are a lot of games that are not appropriate for little kids it’s best to monitor them and even play with them we’ve been playing it for a few years and lo only plays on roblox when we’re playing with them they’re also only allowed to play games that we have played ourselves and added to their favorite list so we know it’s appropriate to name a few of our favorite games like work at a pizza place which allows you to earn money by “working” in various positions in a pizza restaurant and you can buy furniture for your home in game make your house bigger buy clothes and accessories in that game club roblox is a roleplaying game where it’s a city you have your own house that you can customize upgrade change work in different buildings roleplay in other careers like hospital police station daycare etc build a boat for treasure is where you build a boat using blocks and if you can pass the course at the end there is a treasure chest where you can earn coins and new building materials there’s a firefighter game not sure what it was called is great for little kids because you get to drive around the city in the firetruck and put out fires bee swarm simulator is a game where you collect pollen from flowers take it to your hive where your bees make honey and you use the honey as “money” to unlock more bees bee hive spots and to upgrade your tools there’s also shooting games for older kids and adults … we don’t play those but there is a game called big paintball that we play sometimes which is just teams blue vs red trying to get the other team my husband found a game like rust that he enjoys playing as well there’s a whole bunch of different kinds of games that’s good for little kids and it’s fun for parents to play with their kids too if you play it with little kids you can set their profile to their age and it won’t show inappropriate words in the chat for kids under i think which is based on the age on their profile you can also turn off the chat to prevent kids from seeing any chat at all from other players and it also prevents them from being able to chat there’s even an account restriction which only allows curated content from

'spelling']",17385,roblox hi parents for those of you who may not be familiar with roblox it's a website application that is kindof like an mmorpg for kids there's hundreds of different games from survivor tv show clones to fashion shows to zombie games its free to play but there is paid content as well the site is specifically targeted to kids and teens there's a chat feature that can be disabled and it is somewhat heavily auto moderated i want to take a moment and share my experiences with it along with a question or two and to invite you to do the same my year old and year old have been playing games on the platform for a while and both seem to love it recently the year old has gotten interested in the social aspect friends and chat as i said the chat feature can be disabled and i explained to her that if we run into problems with chat that we'd turn it off we've worked hard to set expectations so that everyone is clear on the front end the friend aspect is rather like the steam game platform and you can request that people become your friend it doesn't seem to have much impact other than that you can see if they are in a game and join a game that they are in as well as messaging the computer monitor faces our family living room so its easy to see at a glance what's going on i don't tend to hover constantly but when she's reading or typing in the chat window i make a point to give it a fairly frequent look it is as much an exercise in guarding against nefariousness as it is in trying to help and guide her in understanding online interactions we have of course talked about safety and predators online but tbh i'm more worried about hard or soft bullying online which we also talk about one of the things that i'm really working with her on is this friends thing there's one person that she's befriended that has a cute sounding name along the lines of unicornsparkle the year old is delighted when this other person is in the same game with her and talks to me about this person i get the feeling that she's drawn to this person largely by their name and avatar outfit and less by any quantitative qualities i don't mind that but i'm working to help her get an understanding of what it means to be friends with someone in an online setting she has expressed an interest in learning to touch type so we've found a couple of resources for that i think this may help her now and later as her typing is pretty slow and basic and i've noticed a couple of times that her chat responses come so delayed as to lose all context and once or twice have been misunderstood or misconstrued here's some of the rules and expectations that we have setup for her * do not give out your name we let her come up with a 'nickname' so that she can offer her name if asked without giving out her personal information * don't give out other personal info location etc someone asked her age the other day and she was quick to not give her actual age but after thinking about it a moment age doesn't seem like 'bad' information * no secrets * she won't be in trouble for anything that anyone posts or that she sees if she has questions about anything that she saw or read she can ask and we'll talk about them no judging * we expect her to be kind just as she would to someone in rl no namecalling making fun bullying etc * if someone says things that are unkind to her or other people she should avoid them and can let us know standing up against bullying is also encouraged * she uses the computer with our permission and asks if she's not sure of something we have the philosophy that there are dangers on the internet but we don't want to fall into the trap of believing that a child abductor is hiding behind every bush she's up to speed on safety in that regard and it is relatively easy to protect her from this threat she is far more likely to run into an unkind person or bully and it is more difficult to protect her from that i feel that by teaching her about these things early that i can help arm her with the information that she needs to be safe and healthy and have respect for herself and others in an online setting other parents what have been your experiences with roblox positive negative or otherwise if your children are into roblox at what age did they become interested in the social aspect of it and what did do you allow thanks

try to integrate some stuff to make it seem like they aren’t missing out regular youtube can be pretty bad that’s why i like youtube kids you can pick individual creators and other content so that you know what they’re watching you can start by picking stuff and previewing it although i’m not sure at what age this becomes pointless tiktok is a hard no many predators on there and messed up stuff a kid that age doesn’t need to be exposed to there’s actually no value to it unlike youtube where there’s lots of easy to monitor content that can be educational or fun youtube is already not great for adhd kids if they tend to flip through stuff so tiktok would be a pretty tough one on the attention span with the short videos and whatnot roblox is tough there’s a lot of content on there that’s fine but the kids and adults may not be it helps that they’ve really limited what can be said on chat but if you’re still worried you can filter this by turning off chat options but i’m not sure how easy it would be for a kid her age to undo that and haven’t had to do that myself yet i recommend monitoring her chats with friends i personally know parents who’s children have sent images to friends that they shouldn’t have and those things have been shared and lots of bullying that can happen don’t do this behind her back i would say that you just need to have a conversation with her about how things can be safe and you want to make sure she is safe not that you are constantly looking at stuff but that you will check in occasionally to make sure everything is pg or if you feel like you don’t want to intrude at all there may be a way to prevent picture sharing etc on the kids messenger app i think in a couple years these restrictions can be lifted as you see fit but regardless you need to have a conversation with her about the internet if you haven’t already this can be as simple as hey just like the real world the internet isn’t safe always there is adult stuff that you don’t want to see and that there are people that may try to talk to you for the wrong reasons this is why you only talk to people that you know in real life that are your friends in chat if you’re on roblox and you’re playing with someone you don’t know do not give out personal information because we don’t know who they are and there’s no way of knowing you don’t want a stranger to know where we live or your full name because we don’t know if they are safe even if you think they may be nice in a couple years you can add more details as questions may arise another thing is you let your kid know that if there’s anything that they see or find on the internet that makes them feel weird or scares them they can always come to you and talk about it you won’t be mad there’s a lot of things children just won’t understand and may not be ready to be exposed to you’re there for them and can help explain anything that may be weird you’re right sometimes it can be a disservice when they get old enough to make those decisions or go behind your back and haven’t had any of this conversation or exposure to the internet it can put them in very dangerous situations you’re doing great hope this helps

enough i've never posted here but i'm looking for some advice ideas my year old daughter loves roblox and she used to get screentime to call her friends and play together on her ipad over a week ago i noticed i got locked out of my amazon account and when i checked my email to get back into my account there were hundreds of dollars of suspicious charges the customer service rep confirmed it was roblox and it took over an hour over the phone but luckily they refunded it all they said it can be tricky to get refunded my daughter had her ipad taken away and wasn't allowed to talk to friends for a week i was under the impression that her ipad wasn't in kid mode and that must've allowed the purchases because in four years she had never bought anything before today after a talk and promises to never ever do that again i gave her the ipad back with kid mode on sure enough though i was going through my email and i found a ton of purchases again only a couple of hours after she got it back i was furious we had another long conversation about how wrong it is to steal from mom and how disappointed and disgusted i am and i said that her ipad is gone indefinitely i'll have to call amazon in the morning again to hopefully get that money back too because i'm broke long story short i quit my job to care for my terminally ill mother and i haven't found anything remote yet so i only have a couple hundred dollars in my checking as it is i'm fucked if amazon doesn't refund me she was told there would again be no friends no tv or anything fun tomorrow especially just working with me outside or doing cleaning around the house i feel like i don't know how to make it sink in or what to say to make her understand i never would've dreamed of doing this to my parents and she looked ashamed but i feel like i don't know if she gets it hell i question if she's just so short sighted that she didn't think there'd be any consequences or if she just doesn't respect me because she ignored everything we had just talked about is there something i'm missing to make her understand i tried to explain that when she buys things online with my card it's the same thing as reaching in my wallet and pulling out money i'm just not sure if it's not a serious enough consequence or if i need to focus more on how i discuss it with her to make her realize her wrongs i worry that she's not afraid of consequences or doesn't care enough about them which tells me that maybe i'm missing the mark and not getting through to her is there something else i should add for a punishment is there more i should add to the discussion i was flustered so i didn't ask about why she did it just focused on how it felt to have her do that to me for a second time honestly i don't know if the 'why' matters i'm just hurt afraid i can't get that money back and feeling like i don't have my kid's respect tl;dr my daughter made in game purchases on my card was punished and immediately did it a second time when she got it back not sure if my punishments or discussions are enough to make her change her behavior and understand how terrible stealing is how can i help her understand how serious this is and be sure she respects me edit thank you everyone for the responses and suggestions roblox is gone for sure i will continue my discussion with money and i will have her earn the money back i will say that after the first time i changed up the passwords made sure that she couldn't get into my account without a second different password and i had assumed that without my adult account she couldn't make any purchases because the older ipad she had would always block purchases unless i logged in i've gone through the game with her before and there are a lot of ads and in game purchases but she pointed them out to me and said you have to buy those so don't click on them so naively i thought she knew to never buy anything as this was long before the problem began i will talk to her more about the 'why' again because i know she likes to video chat her friends and she might have felt pressured to buy that

of advice on how to handle this situation but wanted to offer a little bit on how to start getting your daughter to see the value of money here's what we started with my kids and it's really helped them to understand that things cost money and that we can't just buy everything each kid gets an allowance every week that is equal to their age so my year old gets per week he has to split it between three jars literally just old peanut butter jars that i cleaned out and labeled spend weekly spending money that he can spend on anything he wants no questions asked this can be purchases in games snacks at the store goodies at school whatever save money he is saving toward some goal recently his goal with to buy super smash brothers for the switch it was and he had to save for a lot of weeks to get it giving money for any kind of charitable giving usually this goes to penny wars at school or buying school supplies for a supply drive or something but they get to decide if he gets extra money for any reason like a birthday or he does extra chores and earns some extra dollars he can decide what jar to put it in most of his birthday money went into the save jar to get his switch game for the spend money they now have to use that to buy things that i don't feel like i have to provide this might be in app purchases for games extra treats at the store pokemon cards etc i also keep a box of things for them to buy at home that i have picked up when i find them each item is marked with a price and they can ask to open the store any time they want to spend the money this has greatly reduced the amount of asking for things because they know that i'll tell them they have to buy it themselves with their money for online purchases they pay me then i buy it with my card it also teaches them how long it can take to save up for something they really want which then helps them take care of it because i won't replace it if it gets lost or broken they have to save up again they also have to use their spend money to replace things that they lose or break for example i recently bought my son a new water bottle that was bigger than his old one for soccer if he forgets that and it gets lost at the soccer field he knows that he has to pay to replace it from his spend save money i buy the first one but if he loses it he has to replace it i should also add that every other week they pay taxes which is that goes into a family tax jar that we will then use to do something or buy something that benefits the entire family this might be a family ice cream trip spending money for an amusement park etc but everyone in the family has to agree on the use of those dollars

of times the customer is baffled as to how it keeps happening i don't know enough about the parental locks on devices that carry amazon log info to point in a direction that would make sure you aren't charged with the ability to give the ipad back with full confidence that if she was intentionally doing it she wouldn't be able to with that being said if it's in the hundreds a second time i would surely hope that amazon would do the right thing and refund you i learned just how poor i was growing up at the age of after my mother died i was in a taco bell with my father and sister and had decided what i wanted to eat i told my dad i wanted two things off of their value menu at the time and he was blunt with me that i couldn't get both due to not having the money i was taken aback that the lowest of cost items were unobtainable my dad worked three jobs at that time to make ends meet because he had to quit his job on the coast to come back home and raise us full time from that point on i made it my mission to make sure that i never had to make my father tell me that i couldn't have something i wanted or needed food drove it home for me in our time of low funds i'd suggest trying to drive a point home through food even if amazon refunds you i would take that amount and divide it by and explain to her that the money that she wants to spend on her extremely momentary pleasure would cost her in other areas that she finds happiness in take each twelfth and let her know that the money is going to come out of her normal food consumption for the month if it's around ish each month that's snacks and unnecessary foods that she cannot have for that month she still gets her square meals and food that she needs but no luxuries a whole year at her age she should be able to comprehend how long that must be without your favorites snacks and such if she does this again this money will come out of other areas that she finds pleasure in toiletries that are nicer clothes that she would want outings etc money to do the extra things or field trips for school the pure embarrassment of not going on a field trip and being left at school for the day should teach any child but i digress if the situation is that there is no room to even cut these to drive a point home i'd have the conversation with her and flat let her know that this behavior in an adult is a crime that she is lucky it was your card in the account and not someone else's that she would have to contest this with i advise anyone who has had their children use their amazon account in any way such as this to never save your card to your account just add it through checkout when you place an order and let that be that yeah it's annoying to remember to renew prime that way but it's a great security step i have a nine year old niece obsessed with roblox i get it's appeal but it's like crack to children and it's crazy watching a kid play it mindlessly for hours

really have anyone to ask background due to some unfortunate circumstances my year old niece is now under my care full time i am very new to all of this a couple months ago i noticed some strangers pop up on her facebook messenger app and asked her about it she admitted to not knowing these people irl and that she just randomly added them on facebook we had great discussions about internet safety removed everyone she didn't personally know and i had high hopes we were all good we weren't the next incident occurred about a month later on a snapchat account i didn't even know she had she would apparently download the app to use and then delete it so i wouldn't see it well one morning i guess she forgot to delete the app and i noticed a snapchat notification on her phone so i opened it up she once again randomly added a ton of people like who she would talk and send pictures to at all hours of the night normally snapchat doesn't save your messages unless you specifically set it to which she and the creeps she was speaking with had the chats and photos i had the absolute horror of discovering were unbelievably explicit the absolute worse you can imagine believe me there was so much it was all she used the app for obviously i freaked out i grounded her from her devices explained how dangerous and inappropriate what she is doing was had a bit a melt down myself afterwards and life went on a few weeks later i see a notification on my own facebook that my niece had joined a group odd as she has no device so i checked into it using her school computer she has an iep allowing her a personal laptop at school to do her work she had joined a facebook group for adults to specifically speak explicitly with one another so another talk more privileges taken for a period of time eventually she gets her phone back with limited access and periodic check ins to see what she's up to she's behaving schools going good no issues on the phone so i get a bit lax allowed her messenger again for people she knows with checkups and roblox this leads up to last nights incident since getting roblox back she has been sneaking her phone at night and set up a pinterest account in the browser as she can't download apps and has been continuing to contact people by telling them to add her on there and using the chat feature pinterest i didn't even know there was a chat function one final detail that i am reluctant to even put into words all of it from the very beginning was very intense sexting surrounding a dd lg relationship like very specifically always this the facebook group she joined was for one to find the other i don't know if this means anything am i reading into this too much it's like she will do anything to talk to these creeps in this way like go to any length to be able to do this i can't give her a phone to contact me or anyone else or vice versa because it's like she will always find a way there's no way this is acceptable right this is not normal

late and i told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows i said no she would say yes sometimes when kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with kylee trying to defend her i bought kylee an iphone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps i told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and i don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks grandma and grandma said yes i explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen kylee asked grandma if she could get a monthly subscription to an app using her card i said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes this leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card i tell her not to let kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen grandma let's kylee add her card to her phone again although i told them both she is not allowed to do this this time it leads to kylee signing back up for the subscription with grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy roblox also with grandma's permission grandma forgets she allowed roblox about worth throughout the month some as a christmas present and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card accept for this time i make kylee pay back half of the money well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail i find out she let kylee put her card on her iphone again and let kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged nobody said anything to me about this and now has been charged to grandma's card from apple because kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription after kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make kylee pay for the whole thing or only half but i don't know if i am going to make kylee pay her back at all i told grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but
