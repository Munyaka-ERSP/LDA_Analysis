comments and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a roblox shill or a year old kid that really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you as you're opinion's already been made i'm not sure if you know this but roblox does not make the games all of roblox's content is completely player made well with the exception of some events and tutorial games heck the whole point of roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games what does this mean any multiplayer game has the danger of adults and susceptible children meeting it's not a new thing usually the multiplayer game has safeguards such as safe chat child friendly mode or whatever but in the end it's ultimately up to you to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online the game can only do so much it's almost the same in roblox's case these are multiplayer interactions between players to players people playing other player's games not player to company you see that's the huge difference they can't be held accountable in the same ways i hope you understand that i'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason not because i only read a few sentences of your comments the solution is with you guys not the other way around look i understand that these practices are quite shitty but there's a real difference between actual scams and these scams i've seen games get taken down for real scams for instance you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t shirt that's a real bonifide scam meanwhile with your case you're getting what you pay for sure the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated but the gamepass never promised how long the game would last did it scummy but legal these practices are not criminal despite how close they may seem taking action against things like these leave a huge precedent and could be damaging for all of roblox let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of where does the solution lie that's right with you your son is choosing to play these games and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform he is choosing to play these scammy games despite there being tons of other games out there issues that are out of his control like nudity swearing etc that is the type of stuff roblox is trying to prevent children should never ever be taken advantage of by adults i agree but its the goddamn internet it never ever will be safe like c'mon if your child can't handle roblox maybe it's not the company's fault it's not roblox's job on how to teach your kid st century skills they do what they can but when it comes to issues born out of free will what the hell are they supposed to do your kid wants to buy this stuff and if it's due to manipulation and targeting then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit as long as free speech exists manipulation will too connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities you know that if you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing roblox if you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids then good for you you're making the choices here i've said my piece have a wonderful day

quality ones interesting that you ignore every single argument except the one you could superficially tackle you think that this is a gotcha its not the issue is not that there is a lack of quality content seperate people have tried to explain this to you lets try it real slow for you kids like different things than adults they lack experience and maturity that comes with age they have under developed brains and like less complex things toddlers like peppa pig year olds do not likewise year olds have different standards than adults they lack experience knowing what is good and what they like they need to be allowed to explore their interests so they can refine them stop gatekeeping what people should or should not find fun even if your opinion is different some kids love pokemon scarlet and violet even with its deep flaws let them idk do you enjoy watching peppa pig with a cold beer or wine after a hard days work probably not all of that doesnt even matter except for the gatekeeping part all that matters is if someone buying the new pokemon game actually enjoy it kid or not its up to the individual if the price is worth it or not many people do think its worth it i do not i think its abysmal every cut corner possible moneygrabby and exploiting a loved franchise because its still an experience that is hard to find elsewhere my personal opinion matters not where other people get their joy from is none of my business how much they are willing to pay for that joy is not my problem *that* is the issue that you just do not seem to be able to understand you should not have to accept low quality kids content but you should not force them to engage with what you *think* is good quality content either thats up to the child to determine >i wouldn't allow my kids watching mlp that's for sure ironically modern mlp is fantastic kid content if you are actually a parent i can't imagen you spend a lot of time with them talk to them or understand them at all exploring different experiences and making mistakes is how we grow not allowing your kids to watch something they are interested in and is appropriate for the individual child they are all different after all is *actually* problematic unlike letting them explore interests even if you personally do not see the appeal i grew up next to a family that put their kids in a bubble they had no tv because the parents thought it rotted the youths brain not unlike how you think allowing a kid to play this pokemon game is spoiling them or letting them eat shit because they enjoy it amongst other media they stopped their kids from using so when eventually they were let loose in the world they were not prepared they did not get to try out things in a safe space with a parent to guide them and explain they had not gathered any of their experience's no likes or dislikes but they were hungry to find them so they tried everything having to catch up to their non closeted peers but without a solid fundation and safe space to return to every single one of them landed with bad people and struggeld with some form of substance abuse anecdotes are not proof ofcourse but preventing kids from making less than ideal choices does not actually help them guiding them through it does letting them watch mlp or what they are interested in and then letting them watch miyazaki would let them find out what they like instead of telling them what to like

you can either block those games which you feel are inappropriate for a child’s given age or if you go with the limited “curated content only” your child is prohibited from chatting with any friends in any game whatsoever this seems entirely unreasonable the over under setting does little to nothing the “allow only curated content” still shows all of the user generated content simply with an x over the play sign so the child can still see everything they can’t play gets frustrated about it as they seek curated content and can’t talk with friends the “all or nothing” approach to safety and security for children feels more like mere lip service to parents who are trying to monitor their children’s internet time a or year old wants to play roblox so they can chat with their friends prohibiting this defeats the purpose of the entire platform and really prohibits the child from effectively playing many of the games which require some level of communication furthermore displaying all that the child is not allowed to play merely insights frustration as opposed to many other internet mechanisms by which a parent can block an app a website or a game that is inappropriate after which it no longer shows up furthermore many of the games in the user generated content are age appropriate for younger kids and are the more popular games so the curated option includes removing the ability for a child to play games which are both popular and age appropriate ie islands at the same time roblox does nothing to monitor inappropriate games with xenophobic or sexual themes and deprives the parent of the ability to block these games from a child the entire parental safety mechanism is wholly inadequate every other type of platform allows for customization of age rated games customization of chat mechanisms and the ability of the parent to help their child play safely this includes the internet itself where websites can be blocked or allowed lastly the ability to monitor roblox chats only along with inability to monitor in game chats without the parent watching live the entire time is a serious failure of the platform this system sets parents up for failure and promotes frustration and resentment with the children roblox claims to be concerned about the safety and well being of their players yet they take no responsibility for monitoring user generated content provide no realistic mechanism which allows a parent to work with the child to determine what is appropriate which varies greatly even between ages and and places all responsibility of reporting inappropriate content or behavior on the users which for the record they do little or nothing about i have personally reported games which i have witnessed sexual content and the encouragement of inappropriate and sexual behavior i have provided screenshots as proof i have received nothing more than a canned response saying i should enable “curated content” only and refusing to address the inability to chat once this is implemented i have reported games which promote violence in conjunction with xenophobic themes i provided screenshots in support thereof again i received a canned response about parental controls never mind the fact that child can create a new account with nothing more than a name and a birthdate which does nothing to block content aside from a few ### in chats at what point does roblox take any responsibility for their content and or lack of useful safety settings which would at least allow a parent to have reasonable controls over what their child can play and do on the platform if a roblox is going to market to kids from years of age see their toys to young adults there needs to be more than the current useless black and white all or nothing parental controls the technology exists they simply refuse to implement it and or make it available i can only assume their “concern for the children”propaganda is nothing more than a public affairs cya as they hoist all of the responsibility of monitoring behavior and content of their platform onto their young players which maybe just maybe would fly if they ever actually did anything about it but their statements re their concern are disingenuous at best given the lack of response when said reports are actually made this is not unreasonable and this is not the ranting of a parent who doesn’t want to monitor their child’s activity these are the words of a concerned parent watching a company market to millions of young children who are desperate for socialization especially during a pandemic and making millions on them and their parents while depriving users and their parents of the most simplistic of tools needed to ensure the safety and well being of our kids and on a final note the recommendations by some that parents can just block the game as a whole or just set the all or nothing restrictions and get over it is not a response or solution it’s ignoring the problem and passing the buck

'stating', 'opinions', 'facts', 'judging']",12935,personally i just rememeber how i was at that age my parents didn't get youtube as it was just starting when i was a preteen anime certain games like final fantasy x that had some suggestive scenes etc and i just ended up sneaking it so they had absolutely no control over when i was consuming or going over to friends who were allowed it all the way back to when i was little and wasn't allowed to watch power rangers for the violence so i sneakily watched it instead porn blocks and strictly nothing with any suggestive scenes just meant that my friends and i ended up huddled around a library copy of clan of the cave bear a great book but having a brutal rape scene being our first depiction of sex written or visual at wasn't great basically kids will always find a way trying to dam the river often ends up in the dam breaking better to just try and channel the flow for example i asked my parents to let me get a tattoo at and they could have a say on it my mom was open to it as she knew i'd otherwise do it without their input on size placement image my dad just said no and that there was no way i'd be able to i had a palm sized tattoo on my ribs by the end of the weekend overall i think being very strict just breeds habits of lies and sneaky behavior anecdotally the kids i saw with super strict parents like mine acted out more once we could and just ended up lying more and having a worse relationship with parents as teens+new adults there was definitely a happy medium with some boundaries and rules but not always being on the stricter end of every situation too few boundaries also had issues in today's world kids are being brought into a different society than we were technology and screens are going to be a big part of that no screens at all during the week that's strict by anyone's standards an argument could be made that it could stunt their proficiency and intuitiveness with certain tech later on as is being proven by toddlers using tablets having earlier fine motor control and pattern recognition bbc documentary there are a bunch of studies and articles touting the positives of screens in moderation as tools for example my almost yo has coding apps for kids that he's allowed to play outside normal screen time vilifying screens and the virtual world is frankly reductionist; it's far more grey and nuanced than your comments portray now for roblox itself you call it stupid and that you admittedly don't get it that is you putting your judgement of its value over your child's its sheer popularity shows its entertainment value i don't get why my son likes some of the games he does but heck that's his free time and his choice to spend it how he likes we bond over watching him play together and keep an open line of communication skills that i don't **have** to watch every second because we've established what's not good content for him to play so he's come to me twice and said something weird came up like a jump scare game and he checks with me and we evaluate together same with youtube whenever he wants to play a new game in roblox we look through it together chat with nonfriends is turned off and we've never had an issue beyond the jump scare games touch wood and even the jump scare doors game we just play together and he watches me play and helps so we're laughing and joking as we play i love horror movies always have so i get his draw to the adrenaline of jump scares we just have open dialogues about what's appropriate same as watching harry potter and he knows there are more but we're waiting to watch them until he's older all of that to say what you express as fact is actually opinion as clearly i have some different ones and barring some of the research about the effects of screens on kis everything i've said is largely opinion based so maybe widen your point of view from stating opinions as facts and judging from there

**pet sim x** you get a starter pet and that pet mines coins for you so you can open eggs which contains new and more powerful pets this allows you to unlock more areas and therefore better pets they usually have events and such too but i think the game is dying **blade ball** you have to have good reflexes for this one you’re put in an arena and a ball is parried between all the players getting faster after each parry if you miss and it hits you you’re out of the round you can earn coins to open loot boxes for new sword skins and abilities **super bomb survival** one i actually enjoy you and your friends are put into an arena as bombs of all types drop from the sky and your goal is survive until the timer runs out again you earn coins and unlock abilities like a super speed or a temporary protective bubble each time you survive the levels get more intense **epic fidget hunt** you have to find all of the pop it fidgets in a level to progress to the next you always know what you still have to find so it’s not as frustrating you can even spawn them in and pop them or use them to help you find new ones some levels require decent critical thinking skills my son and always love when a new level comes out **find the pop tarts** similar to fidget hunt but much more involved as you have to complete tasks to get to new areas i really like the puzzle aspect of this one **pet story ** i don’t know a lot about this other than it’s a story based game it looked cute from what i can tell i just remembered a few others **islands** basically minecraft in roblox but done surprisingly well **dungeon quest** dungeon crawler game level up upgrade gear and take on harder dungeons **parkour run** run through a bunch of obstacles as quick as you can and try to finish first a little different than the other obby or time trial games and is pretty fun there’s also a few “simulator” games that aren’t bad like fishing simulator mining simulator and surprisingly even laundry simulator sorry for the data dump a lot of the content on roblox is crap but there are a few diamonds in the ruff aka tolerable enough for me if you have any questions or type of games your son is looking for or any you might be concerned about don’t hesitate to reach out

and other sites apps it's a subtle way to influence children with tactics they may later emulate amongst their peers unknowingly hopefully in the minds of those who are influencing it all spreading small slights and racist content to offend others who are jewish another example of this is a recent trend of content hyping up learning german and content with the old germany national anthem tiktok does these influencing aborts that have mitifaceted parts to them visual audio written imprinting color schemes representative shapes music association parents don't realize that what they may be overhearing from their child's screen use isn't actually representative of what the child is seeing or what affect seeing iy and hearing what they hear is having on them if you notice a trend of the same song being played for multiple videos or repeated constantly odds are your child is being engineered right before you're very eyes my child developed an overwhelming urge to learn german and interest in all things german a few weeks ago i checked his watch history which means i have to watch every video he watched earlier sure enough the actual videos didn't correlate with the music or sounds being played and the colors imagery was even more disconnected yet was blatantly designed to be a serious form of brainwashing techniques things shown in the videos were carefully crafted to be swastikas even if it was something like the shadow of the tree branches with the sun behind them or cooking videos with a spliced screen of slime play the food would come out in the blatant form of a dick with balls while the slime would collate together as a blob swastika with the germany national anthem brassily playing in the background each short video had similar stuff with the song appearing for three videos and then reappearing after videos and it's almost always om sundays that stuff like this happens a few months ago it was videos of kids swimming or doing various forms of waterway all kids shown were white except the last kid who was black who inevitably ended up in some dear inducing position implications being that black kids are scared of water or dont know how to swim or get hurt when they swim the background music didn't lead me to feel the videos were problematic so just hearing them didn't set off bells or alarms it was the same type of repeated pattern for the song that caught my attention swastikas and dicks on a roblox game are definitely problematic

frequently game creators can add in game purchases purchased with robux which can be special features like unlimited in game currency special boosts like being able to jump higher unlock special packs etc it’s not necessary to buy these sometimes it makes the game faster and easier there are many different types of games in roblox my family enjoys the “tycoon” games where you earn “money” or whatever you’re collecting in the game and build your “base” or whatever you’re building in the game there’s zoo tycoons building and customizing your own zoo pizza restaurant tycoon store tycoon mall tycoon etc since there are a lot of games that are not appropriate for little kids it’s best to monitor them and even play with them we’ve been playing it for a few years and lo only plays on roblox when we’re playing with them they’re also only allowed to play games that we have played ourselves and added to their favorite list so we know it’s appropriate to name a few of our favorite games like work at a pizza place which allows you to earn money by “working” in various positions in a pizza restaurant and you can buy furniture for your home in game make your house bigger buy clothes and accessories in that game club roblox is a roleplaying game where it’s a city you have your own house that you can customize upgrade change work in different buildings roleplay in other careers like hospital police station daycare etc build a boat for treasure is where you build a boat using blocks and if you can pass the course at the end there is a treasure chest where you can earn coins and new building materials there’s a firefighter game not sure what it was called is great for little kids because you get to drive around the city in the firetruck and put out fires bee swarm simulator is a game where you collect pollen from flowers take it to your hive where your bees make honey and you use the honey as “money” to unlock more bees bee hive spots and to upgrade your tools there’s also shooting games for older kids and adults … we don’t play those but there is a game called big paintball that we play sometimes which is just teams blue vs red trying to get the other team my husband found a game like rust that he enjoys playing as well there’s a whole bunch of different kinds of games that’s good for little kids and it’s fun for parents to play with their kids too if you play it with little kids you can set their profile to their age and it won’t show inappropriate words in the chat for kids under i think which is based on the age on their profile you can also turn off the chat to prevent kids from seeing any chat at all from other players and it also prevents them from being able to chat there’s even an account restriction which only allows curated content from what i’ve seen from using this though there are some games like work at a pizza place that aren’t allowed i think you can still see all the games but it will only allow you to play specific games

been tough he likes playing it but there is always other things that he wants to do like roblox playing with the neighbours reading his minecraft zombie that he read in year he used to be more proactive in his younger days and improve very quickly when he was in kindy and year it slowed down a bit in year and but we understand because school is more intense but last year and this year it is always a chore to practice he would probably do it once per week he still enjoys playing but it seems that there are just other things he wants to do he would say he will practice but instead of heading to the piano he would divert to talk to my wife and then get distracted by other things if i am firm and insisting that he head over now he would say he is already heading over and then gets emotional and in a bad mood as if i have falsely accused him of something then if minor conflicts happen during practice and sometimes he really ticks me off and i can be mad at him it can escalate very quickly to loud incessant crying it does make me think that this is more of a power trip then unwillingness to practice similar with other stuff as well he was already moody when he came to practice today then he needed to check something i let him and he returns then plays for a few minutes and says he is tired and wants to go to bed i was a bit annoyed so i told him that he needs to play through the piece a couple more times before he can go to bed his usual bed time is not for another minutes i did raise my voice and i told him i am upset with him and this lead to him crying on top of his lungs for minutes until my wife came and told him to go to bed but on a good day like two days ago he worked hard he wanted me to sit with him and we go through a piece he is learning and he did well he also listened to my advice as well my wife has told him this year that he is wasting money having the lessons since he won't practice and did not improve she said a few harsh words as well which i think was not appropriate she said she was embarrassed that he did not improve for a year and that his friend who was way behind him had caught up already but every time we bring this up he is very insistent on that he wants to play and begs us not to stop the lessons i have learnt piano at a young age and i do know what it feels like when practicing is a drag however i did go through with it because i like playing and when i was good enough to play what i wanted it is no longer a chore to practice but at that time i was addicted to playing really professional pieces those ones that top pianist play at concerts so i improved rapidly my current thought is that i will tell him that we should stop the lessons if he wants to learn he needs to show it piano is there so he can practice if he wants we won't have lessons again until he can demonstrate at least willingness to practice a few times a week i play the piano myself so i can help him if he wants i tried teaching him before but he is fairly resistant taking instructions from me sometimes so we went with external teachers i guess if i play more in front of him it may stimulate him a bit more to learn i guess both him and the little one does like to listen to me play the only problem is that my wife hates seeing me play because if i have time to play then i might as well use this time to do the dishes or catch up with work etc it is not like i play bad i am good enough to teach professionally and my friends who plays music all highly rate my music i have high level diplomas to prove as well as a result i hardly ever plays since we got married she does praise him when he plays he can do a good job when he puts his mind to it perhaps i can try slip a few music that he may like and see if he will do it more he is currently into music from some roblox games and also geometry dash which is a bit hard to put on piano but then i got to get it past the wife first i think she is a bit set on stopping edit just to clarify things what happened tonight is not usual at this household if he does practice normally either me or my wife if not busy will sit in the lounge to keep him company and help him out if he needs like play the left hand or right hand for him etc or record him play the pieces he think he got it right and also this is like the rd time he actually sat on the piano outside lessons in like weeks so we are not forcing him to practice everyday and earlier today he was playing with the neighbours and got upset cos other neighbour who seems to be celebrating something was not home so he can't ask them what's happening he gets lots of love and attention as well
