twins and one of my own and the step kids have absolutely no rules at their dad’s house they will sit up all night playing playstation and then have to go to school the next morning it would be possible to have more time here if they weren’t on their games non stop over there they have no structure there no chores no discipline no involvement from that parent at all he doesn’t go to doctor appointments conferences concerts sporting events nothing they eat only fast food and mountain dew they drink coffee all day and night loaded with sugar because they’re and nobody tells them they can’t so that’s what we get to work with my kids don’t play minecraft or roblox and we’ve told them early on there are absolutely positively no purchases on their devices as in if you can’t play it without paying for it we can find other games to play minecraft is just ridiculous… it’s a pointless game and if my kids want to gather dirt and rocks and stones they can go outside and do it we live in the country with acres of land most of which is yard and woods bordered by a river with fishing opportunities as well we have everything baseball stuff football stuff trampoline swings soccer nets and balls basketball hoop and balls a german shepherd who loves playing fetch sand box garden hammocks you name it… i even told them they could have minecraft back if they find four leaf clovers to get them to go outside and do something that was years ago they still haven’t attempted to find a single one we had to turn youtube off on the firewall level because they will sit and watch preston plays or ryan’s world and much like you i’d rather they watch better content they’ve lost privileges to use the browser because they were looking at porn it’s also worth noting that they have their tablets from pm mon friday and can choose a hour window each day of the weekend to play to noon or noon to they also have to have their chores done before they can get their electronics turned on outside that all their electronics are blocked from accessing the web rendering them essentially useless raising kids is hard this is all of our first go at it for the most part i parent my children the best way i see fit i don’t give a shit what other parents do you worry about the inside of your walls and i will worry about mine i know my kids have friends who have free use of their tablets and other electronics and when they come over to hang out it’s a massive fight getting those kids to go outside and play it’s always too hot or too cold or too windy or too buggy or it stinks or whatever i don’t care go explore the world you live in i look at that and realize i am doing an alright job with way i’ve got

time or changes in topic from time to time teaching kids to have empathy for others is a great life skill for not only at home but for social normals with others no one would want to listen about how pink sparkly shoes are the best shoes in the world for hours right sorry it’s a weird random example but hang in there with me or maybe it’s been a long bad day and you’re just not in a mental state where you can hear one more freaking random fact about minecraft without wanting to pull your hair out despite all the love you have for your child and not wanting to crush their soul spirit willingness to share with you in the future but the really important part in teaching these lessons is that you don’t tell them teach this lesson when they are in the middle of sharing otherwise you risk hurting your child and making them feel unconfident in wanting to share with you again in the future do share with them how much you love that they are excited and happy about the topics they bring up that it’s awesome to share with people you love and you know care about you do listen when they share even when it’s not a topic you really care about it’s important to them and it’s the same way you would want to be treated when talking to a friend right do give them time to talk and after actively listening and asking engaging questions go ahead and change subjects to let your child know it’s time for something new to talk about if they don’t get it you can always say “it was really fun to hear about your minecraft story today but i would also love to hear about ” do share and talk about things you like or are excited about with your child too it’s a great way for them to learn about being good listeners and getting an understanding of how healthy conversations work keep in mind of your audience and where they are at developmentally though when bringing up your topics you might have to talk in excited tones and include exclude different facts when talking to a five year old but for a teenager you could have a less animated and more factual discussion do tell your kids when you are having a rough time or are in need of a break and try to tell them in advance so you can avoid hurt feelings example i’ve told my kids “hey i love you guys i just want to give you the head’s up that mom here has had a bit of a rough day i would be super grateful if we could talk and share things later when i know i’m not in a grumpy mood and i can give you the my best listening ears and attention that you deserve “ bottom line it’s nice to have our children share with us but it’s also good to have boundaries and to also acknowledge needs and feelings of everyone

'mistakes']",4515,i definitely hovered over her more i didn't allow her to do some things at ages that i have since let her little or brother do who is years younger than her i was very naive as a child and a teenager and i didn't want her to be the same i tried to prepare her for all the horrible people in the world and in doing so i projected my own insecurities and fears onto her luckily she is so emotionally mature and exceptionally intelligent that she does not have the same fears and insecurities however i realize i shouldn't have been trying to shield her as much because i could have very well given her the same fears and insecurities that i do have when she was she moved to montana to live with her dad because she had spent her first years of life with me and she missed her dad and her sisters over there and the biggest reason was that their high school only had about students whereas our high school here has over students so i agreed to let her move and since she's moved i've learned a lot of things i kind of put her in that older sister guaranteed babysitter role that she didn't need to be in i expected her to behave about years older than she always was because she was so intelligent and she was so mature i often forgot what a typical child her age would look like or how they would act because she never acted her actual age she always acted older so when we were at the mall or something for example if she had some behavior that was not typical for her but baby typical for an year old when she was she would get in trouble because we felt that she should be acting more like a year old so she ended up kind of getting small punishments because she wasn't acting her age in our eyes because we saw her as a year old but she really was acting her age and her own eyes because she really was an year old does that make sense it's really hard to put it all into writing because a lot of it seems very very small when you just write it out and list it i don't think that really shows the seriousness and the gravity of what i did to harm our relationship she was never abused physically or emotionally but she did feel like her stepdad and i expected way too much of her so she always felt like she would never be able to live up to her expectations she craved positive attention and we gave her plenty we thought but she has told me that she never felt like we were truly proud of her because we didn't act with as much excitement after her plays or when she aced a test or something like that a lot of the struggle for most of her childhood we thought related to the fact that she was years older than her little brother so even though we were treating them the same as each other as far as how we punished them or what kinds of things they were allowed to have it was at different times for example when my daughter was five that's when she started doing chores she started with simple things like putting her own clothes away taking out the bathroom garbage and maybe wiping down the bathroom sink by the time her brother was five she was so she had more age appropriate chores and her little brother had the same chores she had when she was five well in her nine year old brain she thought it was unfair because she had more to do than her brother i tried to explain to her that when she was five she had the same amount of chores but it was difficult for her to understand because she didn't remember well she has kind of felt like her little brother got better treatment his whole life because of things like that where i did treat him exactly the same as i traded her when she was his age she feels like we often favored him things like when her brother played baseball we would all attend games and we would cheer and tell him how great he did and all that stuff after the game but she never played a sport she was always in drama and i absolutely loved it she is so insanely talented and she has a real passion for acting and directing and writing but you don't really cheer during a play you don't shout over the crowd yeah good job way to remember your lines nice job talking loud enough for everyone to hear you but we said all of those things and more when it was over we gushed at how great she played her role but to her it didn't feel the same i can kind of understand that as i was in marching and concert band growing up and my brothers played sports my parents hated instrumental music and they absolutely loved sports but i recognize the fact that my parents were every one of my band concerts they always made sure i had my instrument and the things i needed to be able to play it they always came to parades or band competitions to watch me even though it was so dull and boring for them and they always told me how great i did and how proud they were of me and i could tell it was forced but it didn't negate the fact that they really were proud of me they just didn't know how to show it because they had only ever attended sporting events i guess she always felt that we weren't as proud of her as we were of her brother playing baseball which is completely untrue but i guess we didn't show it in a way that she could see it there are some things that she has told me that i don't understand or i don't agree with her viewpoint of how we acted or reacted or treated her in general but i recognize and understand that her feelings are hers alone and they're not for me to understand they're only for me to accept and i can try to ask for clarification and i can try to get some sort of understanding as to what i did wrong or where i went wrong and i might never get that all i know is that my daughter and i are not as close as we used to be and it hurts and if i could go back and do it again i would remind myself every single day not to make the same mistakes

then only showed up every few years i think i heard from him maybe on maybe birthdays out of the he missed before i was an adult but whenever we saw him we got to go do fun stuff like go to amusement parks go see movies go shopping and do all sorts of stuff we never got to do with my mom now that i'm a mom i understand it was because she didn't have the extra money and my dad skipped out on child support he was so good at that he'd only stay at a job long enough to have paycheck garnished for child support and then he'd quit and get a new job somewhere it usually took months to a year for support services to find out his new employer and start the garnishing process over my mom got maybe support checks from him over the years of my life that he was absent it should have been a monthly check so that's checks roughly and she got maybe 😒 but she never said a damn word about my dad my mom has her faults too she has said some things that were pretty damaging to me things that insinuate that i'm not a real mom because i had c sections and occasionally the same thing your mom does and she always sounds like someone else has it worse off than me and it's like sometimes i just want to be able to be upset without having to compare my life to someone else 🙄 and she's one of those who thinks that because she did something she hated doing as a parent then we my brothers and i should too for example christmas time my whole life i thought it was completely normal to have to go to different houses for christmas one side of my family rotated each year so occasionally christmas would be at our house but usually we weren't home for christmas at all we woke up opened gifts and ate breakfast and then left we didn't get to use play with our presents until we were home later that night when my husband and i got married he spent the first year doing christmas with me as my family normally did it as all of his family lives mi away after that he was like nope i'm not doing that every year our kids should get to play with the stuff we get for them that's the best part of christmas i never realized it was weird so when i explained to my mom that we'd be missing over half of the christmases and told her that if she wanted to see the kids open their gifts from us she'd have to come over to our house she threw a fit saying things like well i did it and made it work and you guys never complained when you were younger i would have loved to stay home but i bit the bullet and went everywhere because that's what you do for family so she's not perfect and also has nearly empathy which is weird because i am an empath and people's emotions affect me at times but she's strong and supportive she's apologized for things she said and did when she was raising us and she said she also doesn't remember saying those things i think it's because parenting was a different mindset back then it was more about obeying and the parent is never wrong and such whereas i feel like today parents are much more aware of the words they say having an impact on their kids because we've all been to therapy now 😂

enough i've never posted here but i'm looking for some advice ideas my year old daughter loves roblox and she used to get screentime to call her friends and play together on her ipad over a week ago i noticed i got locked out of my amazon account and when i checked my email to get back into my account there were hundreds of dollars of suspicious charges the customer service rep confirmed it was roblox and it took over an hour over the phone but luckily they refunded it all they said it can be tricky to get refunded my daughter had her ipad taken away and wasn't allowed to talk to friends for a week i was under the impression that her ipad wasn't in kid mode and that must've allowed the purchases because in four years she had never bought anything before today after a talk and promises to never ever do that again i gave her the ipad back with kid mode on sure enough though i was going through my email and i found a ton of purchases again only a couple of hours after she got it back i was furious we had another long conversation about how wrong it is to steal from mom and how disappointed and disgusted i am and i said that her ipad is gone indefinitely i'll have to call amazon in the morning again to hopefully get that money back too because i'm broke long story short i quit my job to care for my terminally ill mother and i haven't found anything remote yet so i only have a couple hundred dollars in my checking as it is i'm fucked if amazon doesn't refund me she was told there would again be no friends no tv or anything fun tomorrow especially just working with me outside or doing cleaning around the house i feel like i don't know how to make it sink in or what to say to make her understand i never would've dreamed of doing this to my parents and she looked ashamed but i feel like i don't know if she gets it hell i question if she's just so short sighted that she didn't think there'd be any consequences or if she just doesn't respect me because she ignored everything we had just talked about is there something i'm missing to make her understand i tried to explain that when she buys things online with my card it's the same thing as reaching in my wallet and pulling out money i'm just not sure if it's not a serious enough consequence or if i need to focus more on how i discuss it with her to make her realize her wrongs i worry that she's not afraid of consequences or doesn't care enough about them which tells me that maybe i'm missing the mark and not getting through to her is there something else i should add for a punishment is there more i should add to the discussion i was flustered so i didn't ask about why she did it just focused on how it felt to have her do that to me for a second time honestly i don't know if the 'why' matters i'm just hurt afraid i can't get that money back and feeling like i don't have my kid's respect tl;dr my daughter made in game purchases on my card was punished and immediately did it a second time when she got it back not sure if my punishments or discussions are enough to make her change her behavior and understand how terrible stealing is how can i help her understand how serious this is and be sure she respects me edit thank you everyone for the responses and suggestions roblox is gone for sure i will continue my discussion with money and i will have her earn the money back i will say that after the first time i changed up the passwords made sure that she couldn't get into my account without a second different password and i had assumed that without my adult account she couldn't make any purchases because the older ipad she had would always block purchases unless i logged in i've gone through the game with her before and there are a lot of ads and in game purchases but she pointed them out to me and said you have to buy those so don't click on them so naively i thought she knew to never buy anything as this was long before the problem began i will talk to her more about the 'why' again because i know she likes to video chat her friends and she might have felt pressured to buy that

charged with the ability to give the ipad back with full confidence that if she was intentionally doing it she wouldn't be able to with that being said if it's in the hundreds a second time i would surely hope that amazon would do the right thing and refund you i learned just how poor i was growing up at the age of after my mother died i was in a taco bell with my father and sister and had decided what i wanted to eat i told my dad i wanted two things off of their value menu at the time and he was blunt with me that i couldn't get both due to not having the money i was taken aback that the lowest of cost items were unobtainable my dad worked three jobs at that time to make ends meet because he had to quit his job on the coast to come back home and raise us full time from that point on i made it my mission to make sure that i never had to make my father tell me that i couldn't have something i wanted or needed food drove it home for me in our time of low funds i'd suggest trying to drive a point home through food even if amazon refunds you i would take that amount and divide it by and explain to her that the money that she wants to spend on her extremely momentary pleasure would cost her in other areas that she finds happiness in take each twelfth and let her know that the money is going to come out of her normal food consumption for the month if it's around ish each month that's snacks and unnecessary foods that she cannot have for that month she still gets her square meals and food that she needs but no luxuries a whole year at her age she should be able to comprehend how long that must be without your favorites snacks and such if she does this again this money will come out of other areas that she finds pleasure in toiletries that are nicer clothes that she would want outings etc money to do the extra things or field trips for school the pure embarrassment of not going on a field trip and being left at school for the day should teach any child but i digress if the situation is that there is no room to even cut these to drive a point home i'd have the conversation with her and flat let her know that this behavior in an adult is a crime that she is lucky it was your card in the account and not someone else's that she would have to contest this with i advise anyone who has had their children use their amazon account in any way such as this to never save your card to your account just add it through checkout when you place an order and let that be that yeah it's annoying to remember to renew prime that way but it's a great security step i

were making fun of him especially since they're girls and he's probably hitting puberty and starting to care about what girls think of him did your son know that these were fake converse shoes or did you tell him they were real from the way you wrote it it sounds like he knew they were fake and didn't care until the girls made fun of him for it have a conversation with your son talk about his feelings and fears that he might have for example being ostracized and laughed at by the whole school comfort him and try to take away some of his fears middle school really is a social minefield and stuff like this can definitely lead to kids losing their friends or being made fun of which is what makes it so difficult if this happens to you as an adult you can kind of tell yourself oh they'll forget about it because they will but when you're and all you care about is what other kids think of you it's so much harder if you can't afford real converse you don't have to buy them i think it's better to go for generic clothes shoes than to buy fakes though because when you wear fakes you're trying to make people believe you're wearing the real thing which is what makes it so bad in these kids' eyes they will probably care less if he just wears shoes from unknown brands but of course your son probably won't like that i think you should be honest with him and tell him that even though you know it's important to him and he wants to fit in you just can't afford it this year you can also try to buy used items of clothing since you can usually get name brand clothing for a fraction of the original price that way i know it sounds a little disgusting to buy used shoes but i'm sure if you sanitize them properly it's all good start having conversations with your son about what types of things are important in life because the truth is if these girls care that much about a fucking star on an overpriced piece of cloth they are superficial and of course they're probably superficial because they're also and terrified of being ostracized for minor social transgressions but it's still true that caring about someone else's clothes is superficial your son needs to understand that there are many things about him that are much more important than his clothes or shoes and he should focus on those if he wants to find real friends that care about him as a person and are there for him try to help him strengthen his confidence does he have any extracurriculars that he's good at and or cares about that's what really helped my son who is now and was also very insecure when he was around your son's age maybe there's someone in your son's life who can teach him how to respond to mean comments kids often respect other kids who seem like they don't give a shit and can come up with witty responses to teasing of course that's easier said than done and you can't really fake confidence when you don't feel confident at all in this situation it's really tough

really have anyone to ask background due to some unfortunate circumstances my year old niece is now under my care full time i am very new to all of this a couple months ago i noticed some strangers pop up on her facebook messenger app and asked her about it she admitted to not knowing these people irl and that she just randomly added them on facebook we had great discussions about internet safety removed everyone she didn't personally know and i had high hopes we were all good we weren't the next incident occurred about a month later on a snapchat account i didn't even know she had she would apparently download the app to use and then delete it so i wouldn't see it well one morning i guess she forgot to delete the app and i noticed a snapchat notification on her phone so i opened it up she once again randomly added a ton of people like who she would talk and send pictures to at all hours of the night normally snapchat doesn't save your messages unless you specifically set it to which she and the creeps she was speaking with had the chats and photos i had the absolute horror of discovering were unbelievably explicit the absolute worse you can imagine believe me there was so much it was all she used the app for obviously i freaked out i grounded her from her devices explained how dangerous and inappropriate what she is doing was had a bit a melt down myself afterwards and life went on a few weeks later i see a notification on my own facebook that my niece had joined a group odd as she has no device so i checked into it using her school computer she has an iep allowing her a personal laptop at school to do her work she had joined a facebook group for adults to specifically speak explicitly with one another so another talk more privileges taken for a period of time eventually she gets her phone back with limited access and periodic check ins to see what she's up to she's behaving schools going good no issues on the phone so i get a bit lax allowed her messenger again for people she knows with checkups and roblox this leads up to last nights incident since getting roblox back she has been sneaking her phone at night and set up a pinterest account in the browser as she can't download apps and has been continuing to contact people by telling them to add her on there and using the chat feature pinterest i didn't even know there was a chat function one final detail that i am reluctant to even put into words all of it from the very beginning was very intense sexting surrounding a dd lg relationship like very specifically always this the facebook group she joined was for one to find the other i don't know if this means anything am i reading into this too much it's like she will do anything to talk to these creeps in this way like go to any length to be able to do this i can't give her a phone to contact me or anyone else or vice versa because it's like she will always find a way there's no way this is acceptable right this is not normal preteen teenage behavior right

it we live in florida and the school was cancelled because the hurricane ian was coming my wife was at work and i was staying home with our kids f and m i put my daughter down for her nap and my son was playing roblox on his phone i know i know i started getting the place ready for the hurricane by nailing down anything that can fly and getting all of the garbage together to dispose of it now we live in an apartment community and the garbage disposal is a minute walk from our building it's not a rare occasion that you would see cars with garbage bags on their hood driving by because the disposal is next to the entrance exit of the community when i got all of the garbage boxes together i asked my son if he wants to walk with me or to stay home he chose to stay in not the the first time although up to about months ago he was very apprehensive of staying home alone and would always chose the tagging along option so off i went and was gone for about to minutes on a way back i get a phone call from him his phone is fully functional and he has his own number he uses it to video chat with grandparents in ny or call mom at work i work from home and use mobile internet during trips before i could answer the phone call dropped i called him back but the line was busy i knew something was up so i ran home it took me about seconds after his call to get there when i made it he was in tears and on a phone with someone who i was pretty sure was my wife he saw me walking in said to whoever it was that everything is fine now bye and hung up i asked him what happened and he said he thought i was missing he said he needs to tell me something i said sure he said i thought it was an emergency and called sure enough his phone started ringing and it was a local police department calling back to make sure we are fine the lady said she received a phone call from a child stating that his father was missing i assured her that everything is fine indeed and i was only gone for minutes taking a garbage out prior to hurricane hitting the area she said thank you for confirming and that was the end of it but my son was in so much stress he thought the police will come and take him away from us and place him with foster parents his best friend's parents are going through a really bad divorce that's where he gets his info from i did my best to convince him it is not going to happen unless he will continue calling the police every time i'm gone for less than minutes obviously i'm not going to leave him home alone again even if he begs me to we had a long conversation about what real emergencies are and when it's a good call to get the police involved he was shaken for about minutes or so after it happened and then went to his usual self he brought it up again when my wife came home and we went through what the emergency situations are again he truly believed it was an emergency and i was lost or something that is why he made a call i blame roblox he might have lost the track of time playing his rainbow friends game for context we never left our kids home alone not a single time cleaning outside or walking a dog if they don't want to join but can still see us is the only time when they are inside by themselves anyway i would love if you could share similar incidents and how you handled them tldr my kid called the police while i was taking the garbage out and he thought i was gone missing it all happened within minutes span ps i see that some of you have different opinion whether or not my son should have a fully functional phone i want to make it clear that i see no harm in him using his phone and play some games on it he gets about an hour of game time per day he may still use his phone for other tasks like reading math drawing etc all of it is easily controlled through parents app and phone settings when i said i was blaming roblox for what happened i was making a joke i'm not taking his phone away from him downvotes will not make me do it as well

candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and i told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows i said no she would say yes sometimes when kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with kylee trying to defend her i bought kylee an iphone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps i told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and i don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks grandma and grandma said yes i explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen kylee asked grandma if she could get a monthly subscription to an app using her card i said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes this leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card i tell her not to let kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen grandma let's kylee add her card to her phone again although i told them both she is not allowed to do this this time it leads to kylee signing back up for the subscription with grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy roblox also with grandma's permission grandma forgets she allowed roblox about worth throughout the month some as a christmas present and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card accept for this time i make kylee pay back half of the money well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail i find out she let kylee put her card on her iphone again and let kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged nobody said anything to me about this and now has been charged to grandma's card from apple because kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription after kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make kylee pay for the whole thing or only half but i don't know if i am going to make kylee pay her back at all i told grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but she keeps giving it to her anyways what should i do

i need some advice i f have a son m who loves youtube & roblox we have a computer that we'd put in his room because it was the best place to put in our house due to a lack of space he's also allowed to use my husband's phone to play roblox with his sister we do limit screentime & the computer has some intense parental controls but my husband's phone doesn't have these because it's his phone however my husband was going through his phone a while back & saw some p*rnographic pictures on there that he'd not saved there was also a very inappropriate video posted onto my husband's youtube account that had gotten flagged & taken down it had a video of woman in the background & my son face fully exposed in the foreground singing some youtube meme song we went through the phone & the computer & discovered that somehow our son had managed to turn off the parental controls & was searching p*rn we cleared the history so we could tell if he did it again reinstated parental controls & had a talk with him every talk has been met with extreme emotions he's on the autism spectrum & has always dealt with intense emotions we have to take breaks in discussions to calm him down before we can continue so this conversation was met with a ton of tears even some yelling and insisting it wasn't him all he does is sob & yell that he didn't do it we know for a fact that it was him it couldn't have been literally anyone else we even caught him in the act because we'd wanted to make sure we weren't misplacing the blame we figured out that when he wanted to search something up he'd shut his door & try to be very quiet turn down the volume everything he could to be inconspicuous but since his doorknob broke months ago & we haven't bothered to replace it yet we can still see into his room & caught him red handed i need to know what else i can do the computer has been removed from his room & the only way he's allowed on my husband's phone is when he's supervised & playing roblox with his sister we also figured out that my husband's phone has a kids mode that will keep him from searching things he shouldn't my biggest concern is what's made him want to look this stuff up he's never been exposed to any of this as far as we know we're very careful about not exposing our kids to adult things literally the only time he's not supervised by us is when he's with my parents who are even more strict than we are & when he's on the bus for school our only theory is that he's hearing things he shouldn't on the bus because he for some reason despite being a tiny year old gets placed in the back of the bus where all of the highschool kids sit he hates sitting back there these kids have been bad influences before & helped him get into trouble he's fully responsible for his behavior but peer pressure is pretty rough i'm sorry i know i'm rambling i just need some advice on what to do here

take comfort in knowing that you beat the ass of this years old dude him does they know i am a children me nope it they did they would be worst him why me no one like to loose even less to a years old him so when people are mean they are jealous me exactly son take it as a proud badge of honour when they are mean its because you are good they cannot reflect on their own failure so they blame you instead of doing what you do daily getting killed until you are better and you become the one doing the killing him yessss me don't forget son when you feel the urge to be mean remember this moment remember why you feel like being mean before taking your decision him ok we cannot shape the environment to protect one feelings online don't feel the need to explain to others you will get hurt more your kid doesn't see it and you see their problem with your kid maybe you can teach her that if she create a different outfit she will have a better chance to be accepted i dont know how autism children are and how they understand those kind of concept if she do something see the results are better maybe she will get more curious you can read what create the problem she is having so you have some kind of power to guide your children if she can´t maybe you can set a server up for player on the spectrum if possible don't be sad for her she dont see it the pain you feel is related to your fear that she will have a hard time being accepted in life that people will be mean to her because they dont know her and they dont understand again i never dealt with an autistic children but that's where i would put the work first if i had this kind of fear explaining why she doesn't get the result she want showing her how to improve the odds working to improve the odds and hopefully get the result she want hoping this feed back loop would stick and re inforcing it through online play and hardship of online interaction this skill would translate real well in the real world kid her age will not adapt to her she will need to learn to adapt herself to others be thankful for those hard comments translate the problem they have with her in a way to empowered her to fix this and get accepted if it cannot be fix and people continue to find others reasons i would teach to let go and explain some people are toxic and will never be truly satisfied two key concept to learn how to get

does she make games on it or can you see that she plays it in a particularly mindless way generally children do have a drive to learn they just might not apply it to the things we think they should or know they should given what they'll need to know and do as adults can you identify activities where your daughter does exhibit motivation creativity an ability to retain information even use some basic skills she doesn't use academically like reading writing or counting if so maybe listing those for yourself and using them to remind yourself that your daughter is a capable person with at least some skills and qualities could help you feel a bit better your view of the situation and of your daughter seems to be very negative even despairing in your post and that might not only be painful for you it might also affect your daughter also if you do identify channels where your daughter does seem to thrive and learn it could help give ideas on how to help her do better in school in general and i say give ideas in the most tentative way possible; whatever you actually end up doing i think you'd want to be careful you don't contaminate things she loves with the taint of school which it sounds like she hates to an almost pathological extent i also think it's worth separating knowing things in general with doing well at school one can theoretically be very good with skills in certain contexts but be completely unable to apply them in a school setting if your daughter got to that point it wouldn't be ideal doing well at school is important but it would still be better than not knowing the things at all and translating one's knowledge into schoolwork is a different problem from learning the things to begin with i'm sorry your mother calls you a failure; of course it is never easy when our child has difficulties and it can be hard to silence the voices saying it's our fault especially when it's people we love and respect literally telling us this but you're not a failure you seem to be trying to do your best by your daughter

been tough he likes playing it but there is always other things that he wants to do like roblox playing with the neighbours reading his minecraft zombie that he read in year he used to be more proactive in his younger days and improve very quickly when he was in kindy and year it slowed down a bit in year and but we understand because school is more intense but last year and this year it is always a chore to practice he would probably do it once per week he still enjoys playing but it seems that there are just other things he wants to do he would say he will practice but instead of heading to the piano he would divert to talk to my wife and then get distracted by other things if i am firm and insisting that he head over now he would say he is already heading over and then gets emotional and in a bad mood as if i have falsely accused him of something then if minor conflicts happen during practice and sometimes he really ticks me off and i can be mad at him it can escalate very quickly to loud incessant crying it does make me think that this is more of a power trip then unwillingness to practice similar with other stuff as well he was already moody when he came to practice today then he needed to check something i let him and he returns then plays for a few minutes and says he is tired and wants to go to bed i was a bit annoyed so i told him that he needs to play through the piece a couple more times before he can go to bed his usual bed time is not for another minutes i did raise my voice and i told him i am upset with him and this lead to him crying on top of his lungs for minutes until my wife came and told him to go to bed but on a good day like two days ago he worked hard he wanted me to sit with him and we go through a piece he is learning and he did well he also listened to my advice as well my wife has told him this year that he is wasting money having the lessons since he won't practice and did not improve she said a few harsh words as well which i think was not appropriate she said she was embarrassed that he did not improve for a year and that his friend who was way behind him had caught up already but every time we bring this up he is very insistent on that he wants to play and begs us not to stop the lessons i have learnt piano at a young age and i do know what it feels like when practicing is a drag however i did go through with it because i like playing and when i was good enough to play what i wanted it is no longer a chore to practice but at that time i was addicted to playing really professional pieces those ones that top pianist play at concerts so i improved rapidly my current thought is that i will tell him that we should stop the lessons if he wants to learn he needs to show it piano is there so he can practice if he wants we won't have lessons again until he can demonstrate at least willingness to practice a few times a week i play the piano myself so i can help him if he wants i tried teaching him before but he is fairly resistant taking instructions from me sometimes so we went with external teachers i guess if i play more in front of him it may stimulate him a bit more to learn i guess both him and the little one does like to listen to me play the only problem is that my wife hates seeing me play because if i have time to play then i might as well use this time to do the dishes or catch up with work etc it is not like i play bad i am good enough to teach professionally and my friends who plays music all highly rate my music i have high level diplomas to prove as well as a result i hardly ever plays since we got married she does praise him when he plays he can do a good job when he puts his mind to it perhaps i can try slip a few music that he may like and see if he will do it more he is currently into music from some roblox games and also geometry dash which is a bit hard to put on piano but then i got to get it past the wife first i think she is a bit set on stopping edit just to clarify things what happened tonight is not usual at this household if he does practice normally either me or my wife if not busy will sit in the lounge to keep him company and help him out if he needs like play the left hand or right hand for him etc or record him play the pieces he think he got it right and also this is like the rd time he actually sat on the piano outside lessons in like weeks so we are not forcing him to practice everyday and earlier today he was playing with the neighbours and got upset cos other neighbour who seems to be celebrating something was not home so he can't ask them what's happening he gets lots of love and attention as well

with her two kids at the very beginning of covid shortly after we had a baby who is now and a half her two previous kids are boy and girl their father is basically a non factor something i thought would change as he's gotten older and figured things out wrong he sadly still does nothing for his kids so their mom had basically been raising them with her mom and step dad who provided a solid foundation but instilled discipline something i quickly came to find out shortly after they moved in when we decided to move in together i knew there were going to be issues but it turned out they were a bit deeper than expected it became clear her kids absolutely ran over their mother in what i would consider extreme ways a bit shocking to me at first we'd been together for years at that point and while i hadn't spent the most amount of time with her kids i thought i had a decent feel for them as people typical spoiled & year olds not too unlike my own at those ages not correct the extreme tantrums would last minutes at a time until they got what they wanted to the point the boy would threaten to kill his mom an year old threatening to kill his mom in extreme anger was a weekly occurrence i was constantly picking my jaw up off the floor the first months they lived here with little idea of what to do to solve this problem four or five months in to our new living situation i had had enough something had to change i sat my gf down and told her her children's behavior was unacceptable and this can't go on she agreed and we decided to make some changes come to find out she was actually scared of her year old son and wasn't sure if he was displaying psychopathic tendencies i chuckled and even though some of the behaviors were very concerning this was not my take on the matter over the course of the first months i simply observed how she dealt with them on a moment to moment basis or when they needed some guidance her foot to come down to put it simply it just never happened until she had had enough emotional abuse and then she'd blow up to me it was apparent this was the first thing that needed to change but the hardest thing for her to hear she felt guilty about their father not being there for them and so felt the need to continually do everything for them while put up with their constant shit again until she snapped then become guilty for getting mad and would console them after she blew up it's her nature she's not a loud and overbearing person she's small and relatively quiet a bit of a pushover in all honesty ultimately i'm an incentives guy so we agreed on a couple principles mom needed to be more consistent we'd instill some notion of negative and positive consequences based on their behavior we first began limiting video games when behaviors got out of control this worked relatively quickly with the girl her minute tantrums reduced to or not at all almost completely cooperative with rare exception not the same for the boy immediate explosion this definitely caused a snowball effect in his behavior the tantrums got worse his extreme anger turned to nonchalant f you attitude and he turned to sneaking and lying which in turn caused consequences to become harsher and longer the fighting between all of us skyrocketed we tried everything from taking away video games taking away tv writing sentences chores extra chores and grounding none of this had any significant impact this turned into a year of constant never ending shit between the boy myself and the mom not only that but the boy began sneaking devices and anytime he did that would stay up literally all night he would be so tired he wouldn't go to school this would happen if not daily multiple times per week so a couple months ago we started looking at how he was being dealt with still inconsistency delayed consequences weren't having an impact and looking at why he was sneaking devices we came to the conclusion that consequences that were difficult to enforce were not working and were often too long mom constantly doing things for him that he can do himself was not in his best interest and we felt he had an addiction not necessarily to video games but certain easy win roblox games that basically gamify the child's attention something i'd warn all parents about i'm not anti video games in the slightest but these rd party roblox games that mine young kids' attention and desire for robux roblox money clearly can become addictive for an impressionable young mind so rather than long lasting and delayed consequences we shifted to a few things immediate corner time for bad behavior minutes at a time no delayed consequences eg have to write sentences i will not cuss at my mom or something before getting tv back etc that's gone we implemented a two hour window where he had to do something productive for himself before watching tv still no video games we give some structure for the time but he can choose what he wants to do for himself turned wifi off for all devices at certain times so even if he sneaks something he'd be shit out luck for playing the roblox games all night long say no to him whenever he asked for help for anything he can do for himself implemented a much earlier bed time so he can begin going to sleep earlier if he gets scared at night and can't sleep a common occurrence to explicitly not sneak he can wake me up anytime and we'll figure out how to help him get to sleep at first of course there was whining about the two hours of constructive time but over the course of a couple weeks he began getting pretty good at drawing he'd go outside a bit more play with the baby kick the ball around and he'd be more helpful with things we asked him to do while he still can't help himself with some of the sneakyness when a device has been left out most of the time he's been able to get to sleep before pm and he's come to us when he gets scared instead of choosing to take a device and stay up all night his attitude has changed dramatically to the point we haven't had a blow up fight in weeks win win win win yesterday i gave him back time with the xbox for the second time in about months or so he deserves it his attitude has improved to a point i'd call his behavior normal and he seems to have turned a corner with the extreme anger tantrums it's been weeks or longer we'll see how he behaves now that he had a good chunk of time with the xbox and i plan on letting him have some time today once he's done the things he needs to do but i'm proud of him and so is his mom we feel successful in our efforts and i thought it was worth noting and celebrating let's hope it keeps up
