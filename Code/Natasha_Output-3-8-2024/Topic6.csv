4,"['yeah', 'way', 'roblox', 'mainly', 'games', 'devs', 'completely', 'collapsed', 'today', 'really', 'disappoints', 'probably', 'many', 'others']",9,yeah the way roblox mainly games and devs has completely collapsed into what it is today really disappoints me and probably many others

other games i put this post on r truegaming but the mods there deleted it and some people are saying it was cause it was about roblox i am working on a small documentary series focusing on all the cruel and scummy things roblox has done the first one being roblox's discrimination against other gamers i often refer to roblox as the bully of all games due to most roblox players being absolute jerks towards people who play other games and roblox's actions against other games roblox gained popularity in the early s and was considered an icon at the start of the s however that start of the new decade brought along a small game that would unbeknownst to roblox become a more influential and greater game when minecraft came into being in after its alpha stage in its popularity skyrocketed it flocked to so many players due to its simplicity and hidden beauty in the roblox forums there was one player even suggesting some people check it out but soon roblox started banning players who said mc or minecraft in their forums they stated it's just for copyright reasons but it doesn't take a genius to know otherwise referencing the name of something in an online platform doesn't fall under any copyright rule or law henceforth this claim should be considered invalid it's also happened today i had a friend who mentioned he got banned on his alt account for saying minecraft and i met another person on roblox who had a similar interaction while it may seem less common roblox is still going after mc players they've also gone after other games like fortnite where they filed a false lawsuit against epic games over a logo the epic games logo looks like the square in the roblox logo but it's right side up this is a clear violation of the copyright rules which contain fair usage epic isn't making money off the logo and it's a square that's transformed from its original product however roblox still tried to sue fortnite but this eventually failed and fell through another redditor beautifully explains that one time roblox took full credit for another game's success a roblox dev quit roblox due to the moderation refusing the help with trolls copying his game and selling it for higher prices and studied unity to make another game when this game blew up roblox took full credit for something they had nothing to do with there have also been community oriented cases where far too many games are bad versions of the other games and in most cases these copies are behind a paywall while many could say this is for those who don't have the money to buy the real games the copies are behind a paywall still and their usually bad versions outside the platform roblox players would bully other gamers i've seen many videos of roblox kids trying to cancel random minecraft youtubers for no reason and i myself have faced lots of bullying and harassment for liking other games over roblox the worst part is people would support this and roblox's actions against other games this is why i don't like roblox they discriminate against other games and allow their users to do the same

most that’s ever been picked into a mainline pokémon game like look how much it’s changed since sword and shield although i’m coping that somehow they will patch this game further the way i’m seeing this game is that it’s an excellent pokémon game held back by its technical performance and hardware issues but in terms of everything else it’s amazing the pokémon designs are fun and interesting the open world is huge and full of pokémon and the rival is a girl i think that’s a first and she’s likeable as well not as annoying as hop actually the cast of characters in this game are so well done and the legendaries yeah at first it was weird but then it started giving me toothless vibes from how to train your dragon and it became kinda cool and cute i’ve yet to delve into competitive battles since that’s where my true interests lye but i’m interested to see how it will work since practically every pokémon can crystallise into a different type i hope legendaries can’t crystallise oh god kyogre is going to be problem again but there is so much fun and interesting stuff in this game and honestly it is a huge improvement over sword and shield i think instead of years in between mainline entries they should increase that to years and whatever engine they are using now needs an upgrade pronto because there are some serious terrain clipping issues frame rate issues and animation issues happening i haven’t experienced any crashing so far and i’m on a pokémon sword and shield lite console but technical issues aside the gameplay is really fun the world is amazing and the pokémon and character designs are fun and interesting and at the core of pokémon games isn’t that what it’s all about i mean pokémon games have never been about graphics that’s something the fans and critics tried to push onto gamefreak pokémon sword and shield was the first mainline pokémon game of its kind and this is the second i mean people argue that fans have always been saying it’s a step in the right direction but if you look back at the pokémon games eventually they did reach the pinnacle of design and graphics in any given era of pokémon i mean people shit on sun and moon and sun and moon ultra but you cannot deny that it’s graphics and designs are crisp as fuck or that black and white were the peak of the ds era or that heart gold and soul silver were the peak of the game boy style of games eventually gamefreak will get to that point it’s always the case

game its mechanics are good people enjoy it in fact it’s probably one of the best games ever made that does not change the fact the core of the game involves little effort compared to nearly any other aaa release it was clever in the same way minecraft or tetris are they aren’t technically sophisticated but they’re still good what nintendo has been doing is pushing out technically limited games on expensive hardware that largely follow the format of all their predecessors pokémon mario sonic these are lacking games that have seen next to no evolution because they don’t need to if you want to play with that ip you’ll have to buy a switch to do it i’ve owned a switch i’ve played games on it they aren’t all bad games i am saying the quality is inherently lacking witcher an old game that needed significant visual downgrades to perform on the switch and was sold at the same price as other platforms botw looks like a game from the early s it’s gameplay is good absolutely nothing else about it is exceptional it’s totally lacking in all other aspects critics have a soft spot for nintendo anyway this latest pokémon release one of the most lacking least innovative worst looking games that will go platinum of frankly the entire s as well as s got on average a nintendo games are seen as *the* classic gaming format with beloved thirty year old franchises they could put out an isometric reboot of emerald tomorrow that only changes the pixel art and get s and s i mean for christsake the game runs poorly on the only hardware it was designed for by a team that has developed tons of games for that hardware >the quality of what their games >what’s locked behind licensing deals oh let’s see uhhh pokémon kirby mario sonic smash bros legend of zelda animal crossing and a host of other things basically every significant ip they own it’s an anti consumer practice to force you to overpay for their incredibly underwhelming console >which games have suffered from this happening literally all of them which all have graphics from the s that all use the same formula they always have with little exception that never go on sale i mean you aren’t to be the only one that disputes this you’re the first person i’ve ever seen to imply the quality does not deteriorate due to this i mean check out just how few games the switch has look at any other franchise in this world even when other companies like sony or microsoft do exclusives it’s almost always for a limited time they usually release on other platforms besides their revival if god of war were a nintendo property or had a nintendo licensing deal it would look exactly the same as it did in it would play the same it would have the same mechanics what are considered revolutions in nintendo games are your standard yearly feature improvements in notable franchises nintendo has sold four times as many switch systems as ps and xbsx’s combined people want to develop for them nintendo won’t let them so it won’t saturate their sales for their own ip despite this the select amount of third party games they *do* allow on their system generally constitute the best games they offer the downgraded old gen games from consoles that is easily the best evidence

**pet sim x** you get a starter pet and that pet mines coins for you so you can open eggs which contains new and more powerful pets this allows you to unlock more areas and therefore better pets they usually have events and such too but i think the game is dying **blade ball** you have to have good reflexes for this one you’re put in an arena and a ball is parried between all the players getting faster after each parry if you miss and it hits you you’re out of the round you can earn coins to open loot boxes for new sword skins and abilities **super bomb survival** one i actually enjoy you and your friends are put into an arena as bombs of all types drop from the sky and your goal is survive until the timer runs out again you earn coins and unlock abilities like a super speed or a temporary protective bubble each time you survive the levels get more intense **epic fidget hunt** you have to find all of the pop it fidgets in a level to progress to the next you always know what you still have to find so it’s not as frustrating you can even spawn them in and pop them or use them to help you find new ones some levels require decent critical thinking skills my son and always love when a new level comes out **find the pop tarts** similar to fidget hunt but much more involved as you have to complete tasks to get to new areas i really like the puzzle aspect of this one **pet story ** i don’t know a lot about this other than it’s a story based game it looked cute from what i can tell i just remembered a few others **islands** basically minecraft in roblox but done surprisingly well **dungeon quest** dungeon crawler game level up upgrade gear and take on harder dungeons **parkour run** run through a bunch of obstacles as quick as you can and try to finish first a little different than the other obby or time trial games and is pretty fun there’s also a few “simulator” games that aren’t bad like fishing simulator mining simulator and surprisingly even laundry simulator sorry for the data dump a lot of the content on roblox is crap but there are a few diamonds in the ruff aka tolerable enough for me if you have any questions or type of games your son is looking for or any you might be concerned about don’t hesitate to reach out
