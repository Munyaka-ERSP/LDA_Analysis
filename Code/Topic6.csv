most that’s ever been picked into a mainline pokémon game like look how much it’s changed since sword and shield although i’m coping that somehow they will patch this game further the way i’m seeing this game is that it’s an excellent pokémon game held back by its technical performance and hardware issues but in terms of everything else it’s amazing the pokémon designs are fun and interesting the open world is huge and full of pokémon and the rival is a girl i think that’s a first and she’s likeable as well not as annoying as hop actually the cast of characters in this game are so well done and the legendaries yeah at first it was weird but then it started giving me toothless vibes from how to train your dragon and it became kinda cool and cute i’ve yet to delve into competitive battles since that’s where my true interests lye but i’m interested to see how it will work since practically every pokémon can crystallise into a different type i hope legendaries can’t crystallise oh god kyogre is going to be problem again but there is so much fun and interesting stuff in this game and honestly it is a huge improvement over sword and shield i think instead of years in between mainline entries they should increase that to years and whatever engine they are using now needs an upgrade pronto because there are some serious terrain clipping issues frame rate issues and animation issues happening i haven’t experienced any crashing so far and i’m on a pokémon sword and shield lite console but technical issues aside the gameplay is really fun the world is amazing and the pokémon and character designs are fun and interesting and at the core of pokémon games isn’t that what it’s all about i mean pokémon games have never been about graphics that’s something the fans and critics tried to push onto gamefreak pokémon sword and shield was the first mainline pokémon game of its kind and this is the second i mean people argue that fans have always been saying it’s a step in the right direction but if you look back at the pokémon games eventually they did reach the pinnacle of design and graphics in any given era of pokémon i mean people shit on sun and moon and sun and moon ultra but you cannot deny that it’s graphics and designs are crisp as fuck or that black and white were the peak of the ds era or that heart gold and soul silver were the peak of the game boy style of games eventually gamefreak will get to that point it’s always the case

3806,"['guys', 'made', 'xenoblade', 'helped', 'little', 'bit', 'arceus', 'unlike', 'game']",9755,because the guys who made xenoblade helped a little bit with arceus unlike this game

4280,"['botw', 'runs', 'poorly', 'pokemon', 'passes', 'diegetically', 'explained', 'one', 'game']",10447,botw runs as poorly as this pokemon it passes because it's diegetically explained why there is no one in the game

aaa release it was clever in the same way minecraft or tetris are they aren’t technically sophisticated but they’re still good what nintendo has been doing is pushing out technically limited games on expensive hardware that largely follow the format of all their predecessors pokémon mario sonic these are lacking games that have seen next to no evolution because they don’t need to if you want to play with that ip you’ll have to buy a switch to do it i’ve owned a switch i’ve played games on it they aren’t all bad games i am saying the quality is inherently lacking witcher an old game that needed significant visual downgrades to perform on the switch and was sold at the same price as other platforms botw looks like a game from the early s it’s gameplay is good absolutely nothing else about it is exceptional it’s totally lacking in all other aspects critics have a soft spot for nintendo anyway this latest pokémon release one of the most lacking least innovative worst looking games that will go platinum of frankly the entire s as well as s got on average a nintendo games are seen as *the* classic gaming format with beloved thirty year old franchises they could put out an isometric reboot of emerald tomorrow that only changes the pixel art and get s and s i mean for christsake the game runs poorly on the only hardware it was designed for by a team that has developed tons of games for that hardware >the quality of what their games >what’s locked behind licensing deals oh let’s see uhhh pokémon kirby mario sonic smash bros legend of zelda animal crossing and a host of other things basically every significant ip they own it’s an anti consumer practice to force you to overpay for their incredibly underwhelming console >which games have suffered from this happening literally all of them which all have graphics from the s that all use the same formula they always have with little exception that never go on sale i mean you aren’t to be the only one that disputes this you’re the first person i’ve ever seen to imply the quality does not deteriorate due to this i mean check out just how few games the switch has look at any other franchise in this world even when other companies like sony or microsoft do exclusives it’s almost always for a limited time they usually release on other platforms besides their revival if god of war were a nintendo property or had a nintendo licensing deal it would look exactly the same as it did in it would play the same it would have the same mechanics what are considered revolutions in nintendo games are your standard yearly feature improvements in notable franchises nintendo has sold four times as many switch systems as ps and xbsx’s combined people want to develop for them nintendo won’t let them so it won’t saturate their sales for their own ip despite this the select amount of third party games they *do* allow on their system generally constitute the best games they offer the downgraded old gen games from consoles that is easily the best evidence
