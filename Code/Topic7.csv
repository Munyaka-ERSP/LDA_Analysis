no longer that side projects made just for fun can get popular use money to make money now apply even if you don't intend to earn money * optimizing to appeal to the most player as possible can result in monoculture in the long term games can become more bland and or more of the same overtime look at the devhunt and some could argue even ; so many participating games are absolutely optimized to the max for maximum profits and play time without considering players' enjoyment while also putting in as little effort and creativity it as possible some even used psychological tricks to get you to buy things roblox could do better in quality control but i think if devex isn't here these devhunts could be at least a bit more bearable now i understand that there's no going back now as much as i want them to people have already made roblox development their main job and i absolutely do not want to ruin anyone's living on this planet earth changes of the devex kind is simply irreversible and i understand it i'm not protesting for devex to be removed i just want to express my thoughts this is just my opinion i can be wrong but things like this have at least for me ruined youtube in the recent years; now that people have taken youtube as a job many have to obey the algorithm just to make a rent many censor themselves because they don't want to risk being demonetized videos that should be shorter are stretched to \~ min for maximum ad revenue clickbait are used to lure in the most views some creators sacrifice quality just to pump out new videos every day then there are tycoons churning out inappropriate and uncreative cartoons because they're lured in by money some now even openly admits to using clickbait after being called out but ultimately shrugged it as it's just business yes roblox and youtube is not the same but devex have already made an impact for better or for worse it seems everything is all about money now and i mean only and purely about money and yes this monetization schemes did bring more production value to both roblox games and youtube videos but i find that it's getting harder to find enjoyable roblox games or youtube videos that respect my time after these schemes take place for me production value doesn't always mean it's going to be enjoyable i'm also very sorry for the long reply these are just my opinion

saddening but i get the reasoning so i went to go make an account the amount of usernames that were taken is absurd then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least but after like a half hour i finally got in the front page pretty much looked the same it didn’t have my classic red r but that’s okay lol i didn’t know what to play as there were tones of games but then i found murder mystery i’m glad murder mystery games were still around so i clicked it at first it was pretty normal lobby spectate and the shop then i went into the back room and figured out you could vote which was pretty neat i don’t remember if they had that before besides that it felt a bit small but was pretty great other people in the lobby were dripped out there was even a coca cola lady which was actually really cool we load in to a game with this hotel type map i got innocent which was expected lol anyways i noticed coins on the ground so i picked those everyone i saw up with out really worrying about the murderer i didn’t realize there were so many hiding spots then i get earraped by this dude with a boombox on his back you think for the hardcore censorship roblox does now they would fix that anyways i heard a gunshot then we loaded back up into the lobby we won d i went to the shop to see what i could buy with my coins then i realized you need to play for awhile just to get a knife i went back to the front page i saw this game called adopt me was on popular so i decided to play it i loaded in to this dope menu they asked me if i want to become a baby or adult so i chose adult cause why not i went into the tutorial and the amount of customization is insane i left my house with this cool animation then a arrow is pointing me to a white wall i go in then there is this beautiful hub lots of stuff to do i was overwhelmed i make it to the middle which i was surrounded with stuff to buy then i got a pop up to buy this and that but a lot of it was robux i felt like i was in the middle of a indian tech scam anyways i make it inside to adopt a child turns out no children were able to be adopted but it didn’t bother me because i was to busy looking at all the cool animations i go back to the front page to realize all the extra details they had in the game now then something horrible happened i went to go see how many tix i had but couldn’t find any i google to see where it was but then they removed it d i thought that was a horrible idea but eh that’s all i played so far and it was pretty good besides all the robux they wanted me to buy i’m gonna

other games i put this post on r truegaming but the mods there deleted it and some people are saying it was cause it was about roblox i am working on a small documentary series focusing on all the cruel and scummy things roblox has done the first one being roblox's discrimination against other gamers i often refer to roblox as the bully of all games due to most roblox players being absolute jerks towards people who play other games and roblox's actions against other games roblox gained popularity in the early s and was considered an icon at the start of the s however that start of the new decade brought along a small game that would unbeknownst to roblox become a more influential and greater game when minecraft came into being in after its alpha stage in its popularity skyrocketed it flocked to so many players due to its simplicity and hidden beauty in the roblox forums there was one player even suggesting some people check it out but soon roblox started banning players who said mc or minecraft in their forums they stated it's just for copyright reasons but it doesn't take a genius to know otherwise referencing the name of something in an online platform doesn't fall under any copyright rule or law henceforth this claim should be considered invalid it's also happened today i had a friend who mentioned he got banned on his alt account for saying minecraft and i met another person on roblox who had a similar interaction while it may seem less common roblox is still going after mc players they've also gone after other games like fortnite where they filed a false lawsuit against epic games over a logo the epic games logo looks like the square in the roblox logo but it's right side up this is a clear violation of the copyright rules which contain fair usage epic isn't making money off the logo and it's a square that's transformed from its original product however roblox still tried to sue fortnite but this eventually failed and fell through another redditor beautifully explains that one time roblox took full credit for another game's success a roblox dev quit roblox due to the moderation refusing the help with trolls copying his game and selling it for higher prices and studied unity to make another game when this game blew up roblox took full credit for something they had nothing to do with there have also been community oriented cases where far too many games are bad versions of the other games and in most cases these copies are behind a paywall while many could say this is for those who don't have the money to buy the real games the copies are behind a paywall still and their usually bad versions outside the platform roblox players would bully other gamers i've seen many videos of roblox kids trying to cancel random minecraft youtubers for no reason and i myself have faced lots of bullying and harassment for liking other games over roblox the worst part is people would support this and roblox's actions against other games this is why i don't like roblox they discriminate against other games and allow their users to do the same

underrated i think everyone here knows what roblox is roblox is a game where you can script and build games for an online community with millions of players it began development back in and was actually pretty good from after however the game got increasingly more popular the community just turned to utter bullshit minecraft youtubers started playing roblox and kids who played the game started uploading cancerous videos to youtube roblox became greedy and took control of this popularity and used it to get more money on the website every time you logged in you would get tix tickets and you use these tickets to buy things on the catalog or you could trade them in for robux the in game currency they took away this feature leaving the players to buy robux using real money or to buy their ridiculous membership to earn robux every day similar to the way you earned tix now roblox was making more money than they ever had before but then came the coders and game developers after roblox added a feature to earn money off of your games game developers came to roblox to use it's growing popularity with kids to earn lots of money and lets face it all kids are cringy and stupid this being said they like cringy and stupid things so said game developers made stupid cringy games and they got very very popular roblox’s community has grown since though so this means that more and more kids have come to roblox and started playing their toxic games roblox admins being their autistic selves remove features such as the forum comments on games and just recently game genres roblox’s reporting system is also ass if you report a hacker or an oder online dater literally nothing happens you can do literally whatever the fuck you want on any game and you will not be prosecuted by any means by the roblox admins so now i bet your wondering why are you still defending roblox by saying it’s underrated if it’s community is such a bag of hamster shit because the community and the staff is the problem the game itself is phenomenal you can download roblox’s free software roblox studio and use it to build games and upload them to the roblox site where you can play with your friends you can add extensions to your games so that it allows you to build within the game online meaning you and your friends can build things together wait anon thats just fucking minecraft no my friend that’s where you are wrong i’m not gonna get into minecraft and its community right now but i can tell you that roblox is better than minecraft not by the community of course but the gameplay in minecraft you are limited to blocks that are all the same size but in roblox you can have blocks spheres wedges cylinders and every other shape you can think of along with this you can also resize the blocks to whatever size you desire you can copy and paste blocks and structures as well so that comes in handy you can also import d models and animate things create cutscenes morph your character in game code your own add ons and weapons and so much more this is truly an amazing tool roblox at it’s core is a great game being fogged by the immature toxic community that its created

also game together are roblox players and are very aware of this weird “headless” fascination now it’s so popular that kids are creating “fake headless” regularly now and this avatar isn’t even a new one crazy how it’s kept grown its popularity over time this is a tough one and it really depends on things imo what kind of parental controls you want to put on how your daughter spends her money and how much you want to encourage continued time and effort in gaming and her yt channel for us that amt of money is just too much for an avatar for a casual gamer however she actually did say to me that she could understand and justify that large purchase if she was a yter and posted vids like yours and had a substantial following we discussed it like an investment for someone trying to grow their youtube channel gaming experience sounds silly when referring to roblox i know but this is what kids do now and many kids look at this as a pathway to their future becoming influencers or gamers who post vids or a future in gaming development software prog coding etc this is what mine currently wants to do id say that if this headless purchase is something she’s been working towards with the intention of it helping to grow her yt gamer following and subscribers maybe let her do it esp if she’s still got another month before she earns the last if she’s still dead set on it id support it tbh it’s not much different than tween teens saving for that special “name brand” ____ or a new bike or computer accessory or whatever granted an avatar isn’t a tangible item but if that’s what your kid is into and they’ve worked to save up for it themselves… maybe have her make a list of what she’d spend her money on if the headless horseman was taken off the table is there anything else that she may have regrets about if she spent all her money on an avatar id definitely make them think on it for a while but yours seems to have done this and is continuing to do so as she earns the last of it she also seems to be making a name for herself and is pretty dedicated if her gaming and youtube channel is something you see continuing indefinitely and growing and you support her doing it i’d let her do it worst case scenario she has regrets later but the silver lining here is that she learns the invaluable lesson of how saving and spending your savings is such an important decision not to

of advice on how to handle this situation but wanted to offer a little bit on how to start getting your daughter to see the value of money here's what we started with my kids and it's really helped them to understand that things cost money and that we can't just buy everything each kid gets an allowance every week that is equal to their age so my year old gets per week he has to split it between three jars literally just old peanut butter jars that i cleaned out and labeled spend weekly spending money that he can spend on anything he wants no questions asked this can be purchases in games snacks at the store goodies at school whatever save money he is saving toward some goal recently his goal with to buy super smash brothers for the switch it was and he had to save for a lot of weeks to get it giving money for any kind of charitable giving usually this goes to penny wars at school or buying school supplies for a supply drive or something but they get to decide if he gets extra money for any reason like a birthday or he does extra chores and earns some extra dollars he can decide what jar to put it in most of his birthday money went into the save jar to get his switch game for the spend money they now have to use that to buy things that i don't feel like i have to provide this might be in app purchases for games extra treats at the store pokemon cards etc i also keep a box of things for them to buy at home that i have picked up when i find them each item is marked with a price and they can ask to open the store any time they want to spend the money this has greatly reduced the amount of asking for things because they know that i'll tell them they have to buy it themselves with their money for online purchases they pay me then i buy it with my card it also teaches them how long it can take to save up for something they really want which then helps them take care of it because i won't replace it if it gets lost or broken they have to save up again they also have to use their spend money to replace things that they lose or break for example i recently bought my son a new water bottle that was bigger than his old one for soccer if he forgets that and it gets lost at the soccer field he knows that he has to pay to replace it from his spend save money i buy the first one but if he loses it he has to replace it i should also add that every other week they pay taxes which is that goes into a family tax jar that we will then use to do something or buy something that benefits the entire family this might be a family ice cream trip spending money for an amusement park etc but everyone in the family has to agree on the use of those dollars
