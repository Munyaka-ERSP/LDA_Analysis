no longer that side projects made just for fun can get popular use money to make money now apply even if you don't intend to earn money * optimizing to appeal to the most player as possible can result in monoculture in the long term games can become more bland and or more of the same overtime look at the devhunt and some could argue even ; so many participating games are absolutely optimized to the max for maximum profits and play time without considering players' enjoyment while also putting in as little effort and creativity it as possible some even used psychological tricks to get you to buy things roblox could do better in quality control but i think if devex isn't here these devhunts could be at least a bit more bearable now i understand that there's no going back now as much as i want them to people have already made roblox development their main job and i absolutely do not want to ruin anyone's living on this planet earth changes of the devex kind is simply irreversible and i understand it i'm not protesting for devex to be removed i just want to express my thoughts this is just my opinion i can be wrong but things like this have at least for me ruined youtube in the recent years; now that people have taken youtube as a job many have to obey the algorithm just to make a rent many censor themselves because they don't want to risk being demonetized videos that should be shorter are stretched to \~ min for maximum ad revenue clickbait are used to lure in the most views some creators sacrifice quality just to pump out new videos every day then there are tycoons churning out inappropriate and uncreative cartoons because they're lured in by money some now even openly admits to using clickbait after being called out but ultimately shrugged it as it's just business yes roblox and youtube is not the same but devex have already made an impact for better or for worse it seems everything is all about money now and i mean only and purely about money and yes this monetization schemes did bring more production value to both roblox games and youtube videos but i find that it's getting harder to find enjoyable roblox games or youtube videos that respect my time after these schemes take place for me production value doesn't always mean it's going to be enjoyable i'm also very sorry for the long reply these are just my opinion

saddening but i get the reasoning so i went to go make an account the amount of usernames that were taken is absurd then all the censorship for even just a number was interesting to say the least but after like a half hour i finally got in the front page pretty much looked the same it didn’t have my classic red r but that’s okay lol i didn’t know what to play as there were tones of games but then i found murder mystery i’m glad murder mystery games were still around so i clicked it at first it was pretty normal lobby spectate and the shop then i went into the back room and figured out you could vote which was pretty neat i don’t remember if they had that before besides that it felt a bit small but was pretty great other people in the lobby were dripped out there was even a coca cola lady which was actually really cool we load in to a game with this hotel type map i got innocent which was expected lol anyways i noticed coins on the ground so i picked those everyone i saw up with out really worrying about the murderer i didn’t realize there were so many hiding spots then i get earraped by this dude with a boombox on his back you think for the hardcore censorship roblox does now they would fix that anyways i heard a gunshot then we loaded back up into the lobby we won d i went to the shop to see what i could buy with my coins then i realized you need to play for awhile just to get a knife i went back to the front page i saw this game called adopt me was on popular so i decided to play it i loaded in to this dope menu they asked me if i want to become a baby or adult so i chose adult cause why not i went into the tutorial and the amount of customization is insane i left my house with this cool animation then a arrow is pointing me to a white wall i go in then there is this beautiful hub lots of stuff to do i was overwhelmed i make it to the middle which i was surrounded with stuff to buy then i got a pop up to buy this and that but a lot of it was robux i felt like i was in the middle of a indian tech scam anyways i make it inside to adopt a child turns out no children were able to be adopted but it didn’t bother me because i was to busy looking at all the cool animations i go back to the front page to realize all the extra details they had in the game now then something horrible happened i went to go see how many tix i had but couldn’t find any i google to see where it was but then they removed it d i thought that was a horrible idea but eh that’s all i played so far and it was pretty good besides all the robux they wanted me to buy i’m gonna

has all of your personal details including your credit card details and your email address it would take adding a single api to the standard toolkit to make this work without revealing any info to the app itself > it would certainly be nice of roblox to implement something like that but i think making it a regulation is inappropriate given the other ways to restrict purchases what dollar amount would you suggest is too much what would you do when the kid just opens up mom's email account on the ipad and confirms the purchases there are no layers of protection you can put in place that kids won't bypass if you give them access to your accounts if you don't think putting a pin on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable why would you think putting a pin on the email account is reasonable given we see this kind of story frequently in the news this is not a one off problem it should be a regulation at this point because we clearly can't trust companies to voluntarily behave as for a dollar amount i'd set it around the price of a full fat game so £ i'd say the kid having to open a separate program entirely adds enough extra difficulty and friction to put the blame on the kid theres a difference between deliberate action and just clicking accept blindly on the popups in your game there are never foolproof answers but we don't say there is no point regulating anything we accept that regulation is *risk reduction* and that's worth having > if you don't think putting a pin on your credit card before handing the tablet to your child is reasonable

thousands of pounds want an example from an earlier age of tech it used to be common for kids tv shows to have call in contests on premium rate numbers this obviously caused unexpected bills as parents weren't used to guarding the phone it had never been an issue before because the premium rate services were all targetted at adults the solution that got in place was incredibly weak shows were forced to say remember to get the bill payers permission before making a call but worked pretty well were there still instances of kids calling in without permission absolutely but much less than

also game together are roblox players and are very aware of this weird “headless” fascination now it’s so popular that kids are creating “fake headless” regularly now and this avatar isn’t even a new one crazy how it’s kept grown its popularity over time this is a tough one and it really depends on things imo what kind of parental controls you want to put on how your daughter spends her money and how much you want to encourage continued time and effort in gaming and her yt channel for us that amt of money is just too much for an avatar for a casual gamer however she actually did say to me that she could understand and justify that large purchase if she was a yter and posted vids like yours and had a substantial following we discussed it like an investment for someone trying to grow their youtube channel gaming experience sounds silly when referring to roblox i know but this is what kids do now and many kids look at this as a pathway to their future becoming influencers or gamers who post vids or a future in gaming development software prog coding etc this is what mine currently wants to do id say that if this headless purchase is something she’s been working towards with the intention of it helping to grow her yt gamer following and subscribers maybe let her do it esp if she’s still got another month before she earns the last if she’s still dead set on it id support it tbh it’s not much different than tween teens saving for that special “name brand” ____ or a new bike or computer accessory or whatever granted an avatar isn’t a tangible item but if that’s what your kid is into and they’ve worked to save up for it themselves… maybe have her make a list of what she’d spend her money on if the headless horseman was taken off the table is there anything else that she may have regrets about if she spent all her money on an avatar id definitely make them think on it for a while but yours seems to have done this and is continuing to do so as she earns the last of it she also seems to be making a name for herself and is pretty dedicated if her gaming and youtube channel is something you see continuing indefinitely and growing and you support her doing it i’d let her do it worst case scenario she has regrets later but the silver lining here is that she learns the invaluable lesson of how saving and spending your savings is such an important decision not to be taken lightly that will be ever present throughout life and whether she spends it on the avatar or something else she will also learn that building up your savings again like that isn’t easy and that could also help grow her appreciation for what it takes to save money and spend it wisely

of advice on how to handle this situation but wanted to offer a little bit on how to start getting your daughter to see the value of money here's what we started with my kids and it's really helped them to understand that things cost money and that we can't just buy everything each kid gets an allowance every week that is equal to their age so my year old gets per week he has to split it between three jars literally just old peanut butter jars that i cleaned out and labeled spend weekly spending money that he can spend on anything he wants no questions asked this can be purchases in games snacks at the store goodies at school whatever save money he is saving toward some goal recently his goal with to buy super smash brothers for the switch it was and he had to save for a lot of weeks to get it giving money for any kind of charitable giving usually this goes to penny wars at school or buying school supplies for a supply drive or something but they get to decide if he gets extra money for any reason like a birthday or he does extra chores and earns some extra dollars he can decide what jar to put it in most of his birthday money went into the save jar to get his switch game for the spend money they now have to use that to buy things that i don't feel like i have to provide this might be in app purchases for games extra treats at the store pokemon cards etc i also keep a box of things for them to buy at home that i have picked up when i find them each item is marked with a price and they can ask to open the store any time they want to spend the money this has greatly reduced the amount of asking for things because they know that i'll tell them they have to buy it themselves with their money for online purchases they pay me then i buy it with my card it also teaches them how long it can take to save up for something they really want which then helps them take care of it because i won't replace it if it gets lost or broken they have to save up again they also have to use their spend money to replace things that they lose or break for example i recently bought my son a new water bottle that was bigger than his old one for soccer if he forgets that and it gets lost at the soccer field he knows that he has to pay to replace it from his spend save money i buy the first one but if he loses it he has to replace it i should also add that every other week they pay taxes which is that goes into a family tax jar that we will then use to do something or buy something that benefits the entire family this might be a family ice cream trip spending money for an amusement park etc but everyone in the family has to agree on the use of those dollars

charged with the ability to give the ipad back with full confidence that if she was intentionally doing it she wouldn't be able to with that being said if it's in the hundreds a second time i would surely hope that amazon would do the right thing and refund you i learned just how poor i was growing up at the age of after my mother died i was in a taco bell with my father and sister and had decided what i wanted to eat i told my dad i wanted two things off of their value menu at the time and he was blunt with me that i couldn't get both due to not having the money i was taken aback that the lowest of cost items were unobtainable my dad worked three jobs at that time to make ends meet because he had to quit his job on the coast to come back home and raise us full time from that point on i made it my mission to make sure that i never had to make my father tell me that i couldn't have something i wanted or needed food drove it home for me in our time of low funds i'd suggest trying to drive a point home through food even if amazon refunds you i would take that amount and divide it by and explain to her that the money that she wants to spend on her extremely momentary pleasure would cost her in other areas that she finds happiness in take each twelfth and let her know that the money is going to come out of her normal food consumption for the month if it's around ish each month that's snacks and unnecessary foods that she cannot have for that month she still gets her square meals and food that she needs but no luxuries a whole year at her age she should be able to comprehend how long that must be without your favorites snacks and such if she does this again this money will come out of other areas that she finds pleasure in toiletries that are nicer clothes that she would want outings etc money to do the extra things or field trips for school the pure embarrassment of not going on a field trip and being left at school for the day should teach any child but i digress if the situation is that there is no room to even cut these to drive a point home i'd have the conversation with her and flat let her know that this behavior in an adult is a crime that she is lucky it was your card in the account and not someone else's that she would have to contest this with i advise anyone who has had their children use their amazon account in any way such as this to never save your card to your account just add it through checkout when you place an order and let that be that yeah it's annoying to remember to renew prime that way but it's a great security step i

candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and i told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows i said no she would say yes sometimes when kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with kylee trying to defend her i bought kylee an iphone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps i told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and i don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks grandma and grandma said yes i explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen kylee asked grandma if she could get a monthly subscription to an app using her card i said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes this leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card i tell her not to let kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen grandma let's kylee add her card to her phone again although i told them both she is not allowed to do this this time it leads to kylee signing back up for the subscription with grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy roblox also with grandma's permission grandma forgets she allowed roblox about worth throughout the month some as a christmas present and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card accept for this time i make kylee pay back half of the money well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail i find out she let kylee put her card on her iphone again and let kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged nobody said anything to me about this and now has been charged to grandma's card from apple because kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription after kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make kylee pay for the whole thing or only half but i don't know if i am going to make kylee pay her back at all i told grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but
