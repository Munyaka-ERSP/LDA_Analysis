Sadly when he went in to the game it was not the real game but just a small area with a hut and a sign saying 'Under Construction'..  The game was run by someone called iiSorryyy.  Basically he's been scammed.  I have contacted Roblox but they literally don't care that this happened.  I'm sure this game has a large following and the genuine one is a good game but how is that there are literally 10 versions of the same game by different people, how do we know the genuine one?  The one we purchased had 94% thumbs up and 0% thumbs down and had all the correct pictures and descriptions.  It's incredibly frustrating that Roblox can't underdstand the situation and sucks that my son is so disappointed to have spent all his Robux and got nothing. Grrr..\n",

            "Note: Do not go onto this or any other site that claims to give free Robux, unless you know what you are doing. They likely collect personal info and can lead to you getting scammed. Use a burner account and only access it in a virtual machine if you really want to investigate this. If this sort of post is not allowed, my apologies and I understand if it is removed.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you've been on a Roblox game with over 1000 players online, you've probably seen someone say something related to some free Robux site. The site goes by many different names, but all the links redirect to one site, Blox.Land. If you pay attention to the accounts that advertise this site, they all are just random characters, and they usually will join the game for one second, paste in a message, then leave. If you watch a place's spawn point, you can sometimes see them pop in and out. My best guess is these accounts are generated with some sort of automatic script, then another script uses them to advertise the site on popular games. Sometimes these bots will even make their posts look like system messages, in order to make it look like it's coming from the game itself and not some random person. All of these things undeniably make this site look incredibly shady.\n",
            "\n",
            "As someone who's spent countless hours researching various different kinds of scams, I became interested in what the purpose of this site was. At first I thought it may be a phishing site to hack accounts to use to add to their collection of bot scripts to continue the cycle, but considering the random characters in the usernames of the accounts advertising the site, I realized this is very unlikely. I realized it was more likely a survey scam, in which the site promises you something but requires you to complete an \"offer\" first before you can get it. The user completes this offer, which asks for many personal details. The person who got them to do the survey then likely pays them for every click their site gets. However, the user obviously never gets what they were promised, and just ends up losing time and their personal data.\n",
            "\n",
            "I decided that I wanted a definite answer, so I decided to load up a virtual machine in order to see just what Blox.Land was doing. It turned out that it was indeed a survey site. The site asks you for your Roblox username, then gives you a list of offers to complete in exchange for Robux. Every time you complete one of these offers, you get Robux put into your \"bank,\" which you can apparently withdraw to your account for use. I was near certain that nothing would happen, or the site would keep asking you to complete offers in order to get your Robux, but I was suprised to find out that it actually *does* give you Robux.\n",
            "\n",
            "I completed enough of these offers to get 3 Robux into my account, and then withdrew them. It asked me to join a group, which I did, and suprisingly enough, I had gained 3 Robux. For a second I was confused, as I hadn't expected this, but then I realized the brilliance of it all. The way the site works is the site owner buys a ton of Robux, puts it all into a group for distribution, and then allows the site's users to get these Robux by finishing the offers at a very low return rate, giving the end user the amount of Robux expected and making the site owner profits as a result.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall I would not suggest you use this site, even though it is technically legitimate. The ways the site owner uses to get users to their site is deceptive and very annoying, as it essentially ruins Roblox's in game chat. There's also the possibility Roblox may ban anyone who received Robux from them, which is unlikely yet possible. I tried buying something with the Robux I received, and it did work, but you still really have no idea what the site is really doing. Hopefully Roblox puts some work into preventing this scheme from taking place in the future, such as implementing a delay in which users can talk after joining the game, or adding additional human verification to site creation that's actually effective.\n",
